Further, gold that exists in the hands of people already is not spending any energy; the mining is only for new gold.  Whereas bitcoin mining each year secures the network for all users.  In that sense gold stands out from the other two items in the chart.

I bought more recently when the price was much higher. Just plan on holding for a few years, get yourself a hardware wallet or make a cold wallet (Tails + Electrum) if you're savy. Don't worry about price dips, just hold and watch it grow.

The only time I wouldn't recommend buying is within like 12-24 hrs of a new all-time high. Because an ATH usually triggers people selling/ taking profits, and then a slight dip which you can buy. But I've bought during ATH frenzy before and I'm still netting a profit on that purchase.

4 - their customer service is atrocious.
5 - their forms are written in a way that's ambiguous and unclear on purpose so that they fu*k you over if they need.
6 - they stole and fu*k over everyone in 2008 by foreclosing all home buyers.
7 - they virtual signal when they are the first offenders when it comes to money laundering.

Don't be. Cryptocurrencies are volatile. Bitcoin less so than others, but still very volatile overall. But nothing whatsoever has changed that would make it less of a great investment.

The question should not be ""will Bitcoin do nothing but go up"", because the answer is no. The answer is no to any investment you can possibly think of, even bonds when you factor in inflation.

The question should be ""is Bitcoin likely to have a better ROI than other things I can invest in""? If you thought the answer was yes the day you bought, if you bought for the right reasons, then the answer should still be yes. I certainly know I believe it'll perform better than other things would in the short, medium, and long term.

There are no coins in wallets. Only keys.

Oooph, that would be bad. Don't pretend it's not.

You couldn't. Core does not mine since like ver 0.13 or something. And your one CPU would be literally a drop in the oceans. No effect.

I didnt even specify a rig, but you seem to know it all anyways so it wouldn't even matter what I say here. I understand it would need an ASICS but I guess you missed the entire point of this post. Guess it went right over your head.

2. No, the trasaction is not encoded, it is simply serialized, then the serialized bytestream is signed.  The signature is thunked into the serialization creating a finalized transaction.  The finalizes transaction is (only then) hashed using SAH256 (twice) to produce the ID.
3. Miners only check the transactions for validity.  They don't extract any special property from them.  Them miners serialize all transactions togeather (merkel) then produce a SHA256 hash with other properties (like nonce).  If there are ""enough"" leading zeros, the miner wins.

Iff there would be zero hashes coming from locations in China, we are still left with 30% - 40% of the mining power. Bitcoin would still be the most secure monetary system in the world. The difficulty would drop accordingly. Therefore, it would become profitable again to turn on old ASICs. I bet there are a lot of those lurking in garages and attics.

It still doesn't address my mining equipment issue as that's still a way of using fiat to gain bitcoin without devaluing fiat (although I guess mining is actually valid work helping the system), I just don't like that the people with the fake fiat can still use it to so heavily influence bitcoin which is supposed to be taking them down.

Over any point in time in the entire BTC history, the chance of an increase in price has proven bigger than the price of a drop. Plus there are trading costs.  So if you know more about the price of the market than the rest of the world combined your strategy works - otherwise on average it fails.

gv6f5h7,1618903866,"BTW, you mention 'the problem of fiat' but that is just as broad as - let's say - go read Wikipedia. Also, USD fiat is not even close to being broken. Too many people with limited knowledge saying so doesn't make it so.

Now, it is valid to argue that if it isn't broken now, can it ever be broken later. The answer is a very solid depends. 

Let's tackle a few key points: inflation, money velocity, money supply, centralization, etc. We'll hold on the etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Inflation: **(from IMF)** All inflation is - in simple terms -  *is the rate of increase in prices over a given period of time.* ***Inflation*** *is typically a broad measure, such as the overall increase in prices or the increase in the cost of living in a country.* 

Every monetary system on the planet will have inflation, deflation, stagnation, etc. regardless of where you go. So you cant avoid that. How does BTC help? It can or it cant. We assume scarcity will help combat bitcoin prices - and it will - but that assumes that scarcity remains high such that prices go up. (supply/demand)  Interestingly enough, to combat fiat inflation, one would need to assume people will flock to BTC when fiat inflation goes up. IE people move to BTC as a safe-haven to protect against fiat inflation. But people can go to a variety of places to store wealth when fiat inflation is on the rise - goats, houses, gold, silver, GPUs; who the hell cares. So while it can help, it assumes people BUY AND HOLD which then increases scarcity, and then in turn prices go up. verdict: tbd

&amp;#x200B;

Money supply: **(from Investopedia)**  *In economics, the money supply refers to all of the cash and currency in circulation within a country. A country‚Äôs money supply has a significant effect on a country‚Äôs macroeconomic profile, particularly in relation to interest rates, inflation, and the business cycle.*  This is a good one to understand. If increasing money supply typically results in lower interest rates, and lower interest rates help grow the economy, then inflation will naturally follow. In other words, increasing the money supply means that we're increasing the access to money (making more available) so we can use it more. e.g. invest in a business, buy a new home, upgrade a home, buy capital equipment, etc. This unfortunately needs to be controlled so we dont run into hyper inflation due to too much growth too fast. Growing too rapidly, too quickly increases prices too fast and wages dont follow fast enough. I dont see BTC helping with money supply because it is fungible. If i can trade it for something else to use as currency, or i can use BTC as currency,  then its starts to act and behave like fiat. So, BTC might have an identity crisis - is it a currency, or a store of wealth, or both, or neither. Who am I, says BTC. The issue is that money supply is a mechanism - a lever - to increase growth rates or to reduce growth rates when needed. I dont see BTC doing anything here other than acting as a potential form of money supply which is not what people want to hear.

&amp;#x200B;

Money Velocity:  (from St. Louis Fed aka FRED) *Velocity is a ratio of nominal GDP to a measure of the money supply (M1 or M2). It can be thought of as the rate of turnover in the money supply--that is, the number of times one dollar is used to purchase final goods and services included in GDP.* This is where I really think BTC - and other Crypto Coins - add tremendous value. The speed of innovation in this space is alarming, amazing, scary, and evolutionary all at once. The things we can do with this new innovation is incredibly vast. The faster, better, more secure, etc. etc. etc., we can spend X (fiat, Coins, etc.) the better. People don't have to wait for transactions and can spend just as fast as it is earned. This is a major benefit to an economy given the risk associated with holding ""money"" - not invested in long-term investments, or spent quickly again on personal investment. This also opens the door to creating a more egalitarian environment where  anyone can start a business with very little to no cost to launch. Remember, now BTC is starting to quack like a duck, walk like a duck, and you know the rest.

&amp;#x200B;

Centralization: this is obvious and the big sell of BTC and others like it. This is the marketing pitch. This is the defining attribute of our wonderful hero BTC. All of the above is owned and managed by a government/quasi government system that could run well in a vacuum but our political leaders often try to press the brakes or the gas for 'political' reasons.' Intervention has gotten out of hand. So, BTC is in the hands of the people while fiat is in the hands of the system. That said, BTC works within a system and not out of a system and is therefore always going to be bound by uncle sam's rules. How the system tries to absorb BTC (coins in general) will ultimately determine BTC's fate. I think that its too early to know for sure, but the world system is probably ready for change. But be aware, BTC is 2nd to other ideas previously floated around trying solve fiat problems. Crap, even the system itself is trying to figure that out. It would just be nice if the people had a bit more say in the matter. And this is where i think we the people have a major head start. We have essentially operated in a parallel economy created and managed by us. Now how do we positively integrate our parallel systems into a cohesive not mutually exclusive system such that we can have centralization where it matters and decentralization where it matters. Both are necessary - this is fact. Now that the technology/innovation is here, i think we finally have the right momentum and weight behind Crypto Coins that we can meet at the table and influence our leaders to head into the right direction. Ethereum is doing the best on this front by showing and providing value and letting it speak for itself. IE has first mover advantage in some very interesting key financial innovations.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the point? BTC is not a get rich scheme. It is not a messiah of financial freedom, it is not pretty much what most say it is. 

BTC is innovation at its finest and can provide many positive benefits to society if and only if we can agree on CONOPS. More specifically, i dont like all or nothing approaches or bad mouthing the other guy at the other end of the table. Merging innovation like this into a global system is no easy feat. And the truth is, when our government wants to, it can be a positive force of momentum. We forget that.

&amp;#x200B;

The CPU power of a non-mining node is irrelevant when it comes to fending of attackers (as long as it is enough CPU power to validate one new block every \~10 minutes and forward unconfirmed transactions and keep the local mempool up to date, which is relatively trivial).

The specific mention of ""controlling more CPU power"" in this context means, that it must be mining nodes Satoshi was talking about. Only at the time there was no difference between mining nodes and ""normal"" nodes, so he didn't specify that.",BitcoinAcc

But then when you realise you've actually just sent all of your money and in crypto and they ask for ¬£1000 insurance fee and 10% commission but you send it and still nothing. Phone the bank and get declined any refund as the bank doesnt take any liability. This is what would happen in your world where no blocks happen. Instead I refunded ¬£20k to a 78 year old man because he had been socially engineered and the fraud system did not get set off when it should of. 

Especially if a vulnerable, as at least for who I work for, their is a duty of care. If their are clear concerns, it will be stopped. For instance, someone move their entire balance from savings to current account and then tries to move it over to crypto.

gv6kgr3,1618909073,"&gt;If hostile miners try to attack the network, as long as there are a majority of honest nodes vs. miners then the attack would fail.

That is not correct. Correct is:

As long as there is a majority of honest **mining** nodes (vs. attacking mining nodes) then the attack would fail.

The question if non-mining nodes are honest or not is moot. For a 51% attack, only the number of mining nodes counts.

Or more precisely: Their hash-majority counts (not their number majority). And that illustrates why non-mining nodes are irrelevant when it comes to defending against an 51% attack: They have no hash-power at all, so they just don't count.

The only power they have (and that *is* an important function), is to make sure, that the mined blocks follow the rules.

As long as the attacking hash-majority of miners does not create any blocks that break the rules, these blocks are totally valid, and the non-mining nodes will happily accept them. Thus even ""cooperating"" with the attacking miners in building the longest chain.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Nodes are cheaper and easier to disperse than miners.

A ""whole"" bitcoin is just a construct we created to make it easier to digest. It has 100 million individually identifiable units. In fact, the protocol only ""sees"" satoshis when it does its business. What if we can divide the value of the world wide web into 2.1 quadrillion units, how much would you value each unit? That's kind of like how bitcoin's value can be derived, in my opinion.",Godfreee

it is just a second automated signal correlated with that stronger force. for example we absolutely do not know how much economic weight was behind 148 if 91 had not prevented it forking off. it could have been any where from say 10% to 90% after much carnage. having a signal avoids the shared delusion risk. how do you know exchanges have integrated, maybe because Peter Smith declares one thing and Luke Dashjr declares the opposite both with equal surety and confidence. they are likely both wrong in some degree.

but you are right miner signals are only a proxy for economic weight. it is just that we can measure miner signals in our communication bubble and we can only guess at economic posturing of the kind Peter Smith and Roger Ver are infamous for. politicians lie with confidence hoping to grow confidence and make it true.

an actual signal can also be used in software or future contract definitions where economic weight has to be argued in court ultimately for futures contracts.

&gt;Which ... is also what keeps it being enforced.  Without value at risk how hard would anyone actually fight against a hardfork that removed it?

right it is entirely the economic weight that is the driver, a forced signal is just the proxy automated communication of that into the blockchain. similar to how proof of work on chains is a proxy for economic choices of users we can know via relative weight of coins rather than looking at wash-traded sketchy exchanges and sifting Calvin Ayre junk marketing output.

Besides that, tax office knows EVERYTHING in my country and they're mercyless killers once they're on your tracks. So, all the money in Bitcoins is money they don't see (yet).

This is very different than a Visa network. Visa uses a global network (ex. SWIFT) and global banking systems to help transmit fiat and uses banks to do the final settlement. This is a multi step process to reach final settlement; this is why it takes some transactions 1-2 days to complete (ever notice your bank taking time to clear money). Fraught with counter party risk. Bitcoin is different because it reduces the counter party risk and takes very little time to transmit wealth globally. Why would something need to be physical to be a store of value? When you check your bank account each day you see 01010 fiat digits is that physical? Those fiat digits allow you to transmit/transact digitally. Bitcoin has store of value properties because it‚Äôs scarcity by digital code. There will only ever be 21M.

The first transaction in every block is the block reward payment (coinbase transaction). This transaction has space for arbitrary data. The miners use it for extra-nonce, and also to report their shares to their mining pool. This means every miner has a different coinbase transaction. The coinbase transaction's hash is part of the Merkle tree.

And then earning 10% or more:

Nexo

With slightly lower rates:
Blockfi
Voyager

And even lower rights but still incredibly better:
Gemini

What's even more incredible is that the sovereign debt crisis printing the basement problem globally is so bad that earning this fraction of 1% is actually more risky now with fractional reserve banking compared to the collateral used for loans on the blockchain which can be 4 and 5 times the loan itself...

gv71z94,1618922891,"The block interval is to allow the node network enough time to stay synchronized. Nodes need to have time to process each block - every node has to check every transaction and then send the block to its neighbor nodes. Nodes also need extra time to reorg an orphaned chain tip after a tied mining race creates a temporary chain tip fork  

In Litecoin (2.5 minutes) and Dogecoin (1 minute), the shorter block intervals create more tied mining races, and therefore more chain tip reorgs. This has never been a problem, because they process only a tiny fraction of the number of transactions Bitcoin handles. If Litecoin ever got close to Bitcoin's transaction volume, there is a risk that block processing time and chain tip reorgs could overwhelm the node network - that new blocks could be arriving too fast to be processed by the node network. This would be a gridlock which can never be resolved, except by a hard fork to increase the block interval  

The calculation of an optimum block interval is impossible because it is a non-linear queuing problem. By the time the community realizes the interval is too short, the gridlock has already stalled the network. Maybe Bitcoin would be safe with a shorter interval, or not. We definitely know that the 10-minute interval is sufficient for the current block size limit",igadjeed

Widely distributed authority and substantial autonomy at provincial and local levels. China is not a dictatorship, not controlled entirely from the center

False number  

You're inventing a paranoid hypothetical which only works if all miners operate in unison, and harnessing a fake belief in central control to justify your hypothetical  

Miners do not operate in unison. China's power structure - the reality, not the American propaganda version - is not able to coerce all Bitcoin miners, not even all Bitcoin miners in China  

Also, even if miners operated in unison, they do not control Bitcoin. Bitcoin's consensus is a social phenomenon, has no voting, is not measurable. The community consists of all nodes - mostly operated by volunteers - and various other Bitcoin users. Miners have a role - collect some unconfirmed transactions, play a trivial guessing game for 10 minutes, spit out a new block. Miners have no power to change the validity rules of their blocks or the transactions within, because the node network checks every block after it is mined. Nodes are distributed around the Internet, in more than 100 countries. Nodes do not trust miners. If a new block has just a single error in a single transaction, it is not sent any further than the original group of nodes  which received the block from the miner. That block does not exist",igadjeed

Bitcoin uses energy to mine blocks. This energy usage makes it impossibly impractical for someone to produce bad blocks consistently. 

If no one is making transactions, blocks would be empty, but miners would still spend energy to mine blocks and keep Bitcoin working. If blocks are full, they have many transactions each, and the energy consumption is the same. Blocks are being mined each 10 minutes more or less. 

To scale Bitcoin into many more transactions per seconds, we use a second layer, the Lightning Network. This os built on top of Bitcoin, and consumed a very very little amount of energy, and allows for virtually infinite transactions per second.

gv78ibl,1618926296,"I can only speak for myself, I am thrilled I got into bitcoin in 2017, I didn't really know what I was doing and in honesty it was a bit of fomo, and a week after it crashed significantly. I sort of said 'whelp that's thats' and closed the laptop on it for a few years. I didn't want to sell it at a big loss so I decided to leave it and see how it went in a few years.

In 2020 bitcoin started to do its thing again, and interested I read up all about it, halving cycles and all the rest and how its actually a fantastic protocol that solves a lot of issues we have with money and finance in the world. I was appalled at the state of the financial system globally, and having done pretty well for myself the last few years I was convinced to invest more.

And I couldn't be happier. If bitcoin goes down 80% again I'll still be convinced its a great incentive, and I'll keep investing responsibly. I still invest in stock and property, but I will always have bitcoin as a solid part of my portfolio, and I'm considering a bit of ethereum too in smaller amounts.

There are a lot of people here who seem pretty hardcore into it and have massive allocations over 50% which is a bit risky for me, but my 1% allocation initially in 2017 has been added to and now represents probably 20%.

But bitcoin is very intoxicating because I agreed that it would be a 10% allocation and I still haven't rebalanced end of March like I said I would. In fact I bought some more just now at this dip. I have decided that all future cash I will invest 20% into bitcoin and ethereum and let it ride. Honestly bitcoin is so great that one day it might be 90% plus of my entire portfolio. And if you sort of look at how value has been jammed into the stock market and even real estate market you could make the case for bitcoin syphoning off a lot of that value.",AriSteele87

gv78yoj,1618926519,"Sure thing, here's the breakdown of the 3 predictions I trust the most:

1. The [51%/49% Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSD/QBeNL8jt-BITCOIN-The-Golden-51-49-Ratio-600-days-of-Bull-Market-left/): the last 2 cycles have followed the pattern of taking the same amount of time to go from bottom to halving as to go from halving to peak. Now that we know when those first 2 events took place for this cycle, we can predict around the last week in September is when the peak should occur.
2. The [Rainbow Chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/): A lot of people think this one is meaningless, but personally I use it because I know a huge amount of other people use it. If everyone's looking at this chart for guidance, then it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
3. The [Stock to Flow Model](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/stock-to-flow-model/): A more scientific model that actually takes into account the available bitcoin, not the 18 million figure most people cite. Most people look at it predicting 100k, but we always overshoot it, albeit less every time.

These 3 lead me to believe Bitcoin will top out somewhere near $171k in the last week of September. It always has to end in a eurphoric spike though, so until your grandma is calling you begging to get in on the action, it isn't the top yet.",Historical-Session66

I would get a Coinbase pro account and start buying. In the meantime get yourself a Trezor, Ledger or Coldcard and watch a lot of tutorials on setting them up correctly. 

Once you‚Äôre ready to move your BTC off the exchange  start with a small amount. Transfer it back and fourth and wipe the device to see if you can recover it. If all goes well and you feel confident you can then transfer the larger amount safe in the knowledge that you know what you‚Äôre doing.

I'm sure this announcement will lead to rising value of the chosen coins but I worry that too much oh this blockchain onboarding by big financial companies will begin to erode the integrity of a decentralized network.  If these firms are simply allowing users to hand over their cryptocurrencies to them in return for the convenience of spending only within their platform, that does the community no good.  After a few years of this type of thing, individuals won't own any of the their coinz and the transactional platforms will simply control the advancement of the technologies.  As much as I like the idea of these big adoptions for spreading awareness and usage, I think I'll be HODLing till we see some stonger decentralized peer-to-peer development.  Convenience will always be a driving force in adoption of transactional technology, I'd like to see more platforms developed to help small businesses use and store/transfer crypto, even just better POS integration would be huge.  But it seems all we're getting is existing systems saying ""We'll help you give us your crypto so we can hold it while we balance this transaction for you with USD."" It's the ultimate bait and switch.  They grow the market value while simultaneously removing the currencies intrinsic value to society.  Crypto is powerful because its supposed to be in the hands of the users NOT the middlemen.  We need these babysteps now to grow adoption but there really needs to be a boom of decentralized platforms soon or we risk seeing Bitcoin (et al) become dominant for all but still controlled by a narrow few.  Companies and countries are already vying for the largest stakes possible and that has the potential to aggregate into a ""trickledown"" economic mentality.

gv7ba83,1618927617,"OK I hate to put a wet blanket on anyone's excitement to run a node, but people should really understand this..

\#1 - a node just validates transactions, so running a node isn't ""helping"" the bitcoin network, not the way this sounds (unless you are mining too). OK yes you will relay the mempool and blockchain to other nodes, but that is so ubiquitous at this point it makes almost no difference. Your node most importantly ensures your RECEVEIVED transactions are valid - it makes sure YOU don't accept a ""fake"" bitcoin. Sorry but nobody else will ever care or probably even notice your node exists. And if you aren't USING your node to RECEIVE and BROADCAST transactions, it really isn't helping anyone at all.

\#2 Nodes do improve privacy but TOR is not the important part of it. Your node improves your privacy by allowing you to access bitcoin data on your local hard drive, rather than query from a server somewhere that is run by someone else. If you use a lightweight wallet that is not connected to your own node, it is connecting to someone else's node to get the data. Whoever owns the node you are connecting to can now attempt to associate your IP address and physical location with the addresses you are checking/sending from/receiving to.

But I remember exactly the moment I started investing my time and my capacity to learn new things on bitcoin. I didn't even really know where to start, and it really really helps that most of the community is happy to help out,or at least point into the direction to where I could/should start.

A few days ago, I was already able to give back some knowledge, when some guy asked some basic questions about hard wallets. It made me so happy to see that I could help out, and I know that this guy will eventually help out some other guy, and the cycle repeats again and again. 

By not being dicks or rather by not being on high horses, and instead helping others out, giving them information, or pointing to some interesting sources, I believe we can get step by step into mass adoption.

gv7fxz5,1618929693,"&gt;If the minority 50% of miners follow a majority of honest nodes then the attack fails because the majority of nodes would be the longest chain. 

I'm sorry to tell you, but your understanding how Bitcoin mining, the blockchain, and the interplay between nodes and miners works is a bit flawed. What I quoted above is simply not true. Actually, this sentence has several mistakes:

The first one is, that you seem to think that a 51% attack would not only split the miners into a 51% and 49% group, but it would also split the non-mining nodes into two groups: Those that support the attack and those that don't.

This is not so. Even if *all* nodes are honest and do not support the attack, the attack would still succeed. Those nodes simply enforce the rules that the Bitcoin protocol establishes. All blocks that follow these rules are valid. And the attackers' blocks would of course be valid too, after all, the 51% attackers wouldn't be so stupid and mine invalid blocks. So even if all nodes are ""honest"", they have no way to know (without human intervention) if a block was mined by a honest miner or by an attacking miner. They would simply have to accept all valid blocks. So the nodes would be forced to accept the dishonest miners' blocks, *because they would not know better!*

The result is a blockchain that is frequently reorganized, when the attacking miners and honest miners submit conflicting blocks to the network of nodes. And no matter that the nodes are all honest, they would reorganize the blockchain with the attacking miners' blocks winning, because these attackers have, by definition in a 51% attack, more hashpower, so they slowly but surely create the longest chain.

Secondly, the way you wrote ""because the majority of nodes would be the longest chain"", you seem to think that the longest chain is somehone defined by the number of nodes that follow it. This is not so. The longest chain is solely defined by the amount of work (=hash work) that went into it. The plain number of nodes (be it mining or non-mining) has nothing to do with it. The amount of (hash) work that went into the blocks is the only factor that determines the ""longest"" chain.",BitcoinAcc

gv7g31j,1618929754,"I think the idea of organizing Bitcoin's adoption into phase transitions is genius and I'm definitely happy that it looks like the s2fx model also predicts sometime around September or a little later for the peak, that's reassuring.

Personally, I would pay attention to this model just like the normal s2f, but I am skeptical of calling this phase the ""financial asset"" phase when so few institutions have actually adopted it. The Bitcoin community went so long being ignored by everyone that a lot of people get excited by Tesla or Square buying a bit, but when pension funds and institutions like Blackrock actually start to incorporate it, then we'll be to the ""financial asset"" phase.

IMO that's probably coming next cycle, and that's when we'll surpass the market cap of gold by a lot. Eventually, humans do run out of money though, so there's a maximum for how much a Bitcoin can be worth, getting to 5 million a coin is a market cap of $105 trillion I think. The amount of adoption needed for that would be astronomical.

gv7mbdq,1618932396,"Sorry for your loss.

&gt; owned BTC

Well, there are a few ways one can own it.

1. Have an account on an exchange (imagine a ""bitcoin bank"")
2. Have an application on their computer
3. Have an application on their phone
4. Have a device, like a USB key / fob, to access it

If your loved one kept their passwords and secrets written down, just look through that list to access their emails.  Otherwise you'll have to request their email database through probate court and formatting the messages can be difficult for the non-technical users.

Assuming you get access to their email, look for emails that would indicate an account created for \#1, or an receipt for the purchase of \#4.  If you find \#1 you can request the balance be sent to you through probate court.

For the other three options, you will need to know the secret.  It is usually a list of words.  The list is usually more than 11 words and less than 30.  The first 12 or 24 of them are usually [words off of this list](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt).  Words not on that list are what are called a ""passphrase"".

If you find any of those types of secrets, or you find the USB device, you can likely access the funds.  If you only know that they had coins somewhere at some point in time, the funds are likely lost to you.",brianddk

gv7ms1b,1618932589,"I have newbie, but genuine question. What mechanisms are there in place to track consensus regarding blocksize cap? Some core devs implied that it may be necessary sooner or later and if there is an overwhelming consensus, but how and when do we actually gauge that, what infrastructure and standards are in place for the participants (miners, nodes, wallet signatories) to signal it to the devs? 
I get that conservative engineering is what you want where stakes are high, such as aerospace and perhaps future multitrillion $ asset and I get that there needs to be some incentives to develop and use lightning. (I use it whenever I can.),
but I may know more about psychology than crypto. If bitcoin adoption is actually the priority, we have to do everything to make ""bitcoin experience"" as much dopamine rewarding as possible, while right now we are severly punishing new bitcoin users with cortisol and adrenaline trauma for what we actually want them to do. (Stress, introduction to congestion drama without hint of hope in the forseable future, while they dont know what to do during days and weeks of uncertainty and frustration of mempool ""pain""). This is fundamentally extremely wrong application of conditioning.
Read Kahneman, and read Skinner. Trivial operant conditioning 1.0. It is the ratio of dopamine and cortisol release that is the 99,9% factor that makes human do stuff. There are no truly rational-motivated people (or they are &lt;0,1%..). And this is also impossible to change in adult population. Ask every single neuroscientist. I love and get lightning, but market self-evidently choose to prefer onchoain and want to keep happening more there, but cant or is forced into other blockchains. There is no rationale in artificially capping market demand. It does not cancel inherent human behaviour patterns, only makes the more dysfuntional and broken. You dont excuse breaking of dam by waterfall (china blackout), you build the dam damn right! Onboarding user experience have to release as much dopamine as possible (by meeting expectation of moving personal hard earned bitcoins thru blockchain for reasonable fee and in reasonable time. Not meeting this expectation with dopamine and waiting for weeks or paying preposterously imprints permament ""trauma"" into the memory of user.) Such negative stimuli punishment considerably reduce probability of future voluntary exposure to the said stimuli. Try to abuse your wife by consistent negative stimuli (into what you actually want her to do.. to stay with you), how long will she stay before running away on her own or with someone else? It removes all fun and love from the process. All that remains is abuse, dysfunction and shadowy possessions.
Right now we are releasing the opposite chemicals into the brains of bitcoin users, then what we want. We are punishing them for doing what they are supposed to do more. This is not the way to forward bitcoin. Behavioral sciences provides century estabilished consistency between observation and theory. It seems that core devs should study them as a major priority, because their theory is not consistent with observation. I expect social and moral bitcoin promotion is actually their intention, isnt it?

1)how do we measure block increase consensus when the time comes, what devs do to make gauges easier and more effective?
2)is my behavioral interpretation incorrect? (not looking for scaling theory, but evident ""clinical"" observation)

Yes... a hard-fork.

Also note... This is not an uncommon dip in hashrate.  Use the following metrics:

1. Calculate hashrate by measuring the block-rate over a 24 hr (UTC) day.
2. Graph that hashrate for every day of the year
3. Note the days of the year that difficulty is adjusted
4. Between any two difficulty adjustments, find the max and min hashrate on your graph
5. Calculate the drop from that local max to that local min.

Dates of interest:

* Apr 15 2021 to Apr 19 2021: 37% drop

Once upon a time, even I made paper wallets. BUT nowadays I would use the Glacier protocol and roll dice.

    openssl dgst -sha256 path/to/file
    
And you have to find trustworthy binary to decimal calculator ... maybe the built in one for your OS, or calc it out the hard way..

Last, a final pitfall -- if you use a QR code generator out there on the Internet BEWARE. Those are not to be trusted EVER.

gv7qs0g,1618934260,"Hello I adopted bitcoin a few years back and have been trading since 2015. 

The following post is only to help people understand the market cycle. I am a firm believer of bitcoin and this post in no way is saying that bitcoin will fail, but.....

Currently bitcoin just formed a Doji on the monthly time frame.it has been running for the past 6 months and what goes up must come down... It is also a red Doji meaning it could have reached a point of exhaustion. (For now) sometimes it just needs time to rest. 

On the weekly time frame we can see that it has been in a range for almost 6 weeks and just recently broke it's trend and is slowly creeping to the area of support at 51k. If this area is broken there will be acceleration to the down side. 

The strongest level of support below 51 is at 40k we can expect price to react at that level of support.

If the bears cannot push bitcoin further down and the bulls manage hold price at these levels it will start to push price up! If it breaks past it's current All time high the price will most likely create acceleration on the upside. 

Currently I'm out of the market waiting to see what it will most likely do next..... High probability trading is the name of the game.   IG = @trader_joe_Rocket",Jabermonster

gv7rg0b,1618934542,"A blockchain is a ledger of transactions. You ""own"" Bitcoin when the Bitcoin ledger has transactions that ended up in an address you control (i.e. that you have the private keys for). A fork is when there are new consensus rules after a point in time that differ from the consensus rules of Bitcoin, which then starts adding blocks that are different from the blocks added to Bitcoin's chain (since they are now following different rules). 

Up until the fork, the two chains have identical ledgers and afterwards they are split. So you will have the same units of coin on each chain after the split. Your address on the Bitcoin chain obviously remains the same unchanged. But the same address on the other chain will have the same ""units of currency"" like 0.2 but instead of 0.2 Bitcoins it'll be 0.2 Bitcoin gold or whatever the name of the fork is. 

However, the value of those coins on this new chain is just like the value of any altcoin: determined in an open market, and probably very low. Think about it. Someone could have forked the Bitcoin network yesterday and started a new coin called Bitcoin-420 coin because it forked off on 420. They could be the sole user. What would you pay for this coin? Probably nothing because there's only one user! So it's free to create forks, but the coins on that fork are worthless unless someone actually wants to trade on this fork.",MarketsAreCool

1. Calculate hashrate by measuring the block-rate over a 24 hr (UTC) day.
2. Graph that hashrate for every day of the year
3. Note the days of the year that difficulty is adjusted
4. Between any two difficulty adjustments, find the max and min hashrate on your graph
5. Calculate the drop from that local max to that local min.

Dates of interest:

* Apr 15 2021 to Apr 19 2021: 37% drop
* Oct 17 2020 to Oct 27 2020: 37% drop
* May 11 2020 to May 17 2020: 37% drop

gv86j6b,1618940797,"Adjusting every block (or faster in general) increases user's vulnerability to isolating attacks.

Say I manage to isolate your node so that it's only talking to my node -- not a particularly hard attack.  Then using some mining hashpower (perhaps that I've also isolated-- which is harder, or I'm paying for myself) I mine blocks in an isolated fork.  At first the blocks come very slowly due to the high difficulty, but if it updates every block the difficulty drops and it speeds up.  After a while the fork is producing 6 blocks an hour like the real network (at a lower difficulty).

IIRC the math works out such that keeping all the time constants the same the continuous update costs about half as much to attack as the update-interval = window update.

It's perhaps not the biggest issue, but the change isn't totally free.

Overlapping updates also have some mathematical/implementation complication-- because each block is at a different difficulty so you don't want to 'double apply' the effect of prior slow/fast blocks whos impact you've already partially incorporated (so you need to scale your updates by an N-th root).  A bunch of altcoins have gotten this wrong and ended up with an unstable/oscillating difficulty update!

There are also weird fork-incentive attacks against continual updates:  Say I game the timestamps on my block so that the successor block will have ever so slightly higher difficulty.  That means if there is a competing block with a faithful timestamp at my height the successor of mine will always win in a block race against the successor of the other because my fork has some infinitesimal amount of additional work behind it.  This creates an incentive for miners to continually understate their time.  In theory this bad incentive also exists in bitcoin, but just at the single final block in the 2016 window-- rare enough that it's probably not worth dorking with.  Updating every block makes the problem show up every block.

This can be fixed, e.g. don't use data from the most recent blocks to adjust, but instead use the timestamps from blocks at least N blocks old (setting N high enough to make forks of that depth arbitrarily rare) so that usually all forks  have the same difficulty.  But now you've got another parameter and tradeoff to consider.

There is also a related exotic attack:  Did you know that in bitcoin an attacker which maintains *any* constant fraction of the networks hashrate, no matter how small (e.g. 0.000001% it just has to scale with the network) will eventually overtake the honest chain if he attacks long enough?   He just keeps mining on his fork, and eventually he gets lucky and gets a block faster than he should. He constantly sets the timestamp as low as he can so his difficulty rises the _fastest_. Why fastest? Variance of poisson variables is equal to the expectation, so his odds of getting lucky and overstating his work go up with higher difficulty. Their difficulty goes up, and they eventually gets lucky again. After some number of lucky blocks he blows away the entire real chain with more ""work""! -- but really it was only a handful of lucky blocks with difficulty vastly higher than the real network's.

It turns out that if you plug in numbers from bitcoin this attack isn't a practical concern with the current behavior. E.g. you come up with expected success times of trillions of years-- except for attackers that have significant amounts of hashpower and could attack in other ways. But what increases these attacks time is the slow 2016 updates-- the attacker doesn't need just one lucky block to increase his difficulty, he needs 2016 of them so his low odds of getting them are raised to a 2016 power!   He'll then also run into the limit of a 4x difficulty change per window.

The 4x/0.25x difficulty change rule is also another complication.  Any non-linearity in the rules opens up strategic behavior: e.g. bump it against the rail and crank out blocks faster, knowing it won't be met by an equal and opposite slowdown.   In Bitcoin the 4x/0.25x rule is set far enough out that it's not easy to hit and (IIRC) has never been hit, so the fact that there are maybe some weird incentives there isn't too important.  If you want to retain the same limit of 4x every 2016 blocks in the most simple way you'd raise the limit to the 1/2016th power,  ... the result is a limit just SLIGHTLY over the current difficulty and it would get constantly hit, which would be clearly bad.  There probably is some way to fix this ... or just abandon these limits completely.  But it's just more tradeoffs/incentives/risks to consider.

Finally, if the time constant is unchanged-- it will *still* take a long time to respond to a step-event, so the win is also fairly modest at most.

Difficult is fundamentally a security mechanism and like others there are lots of ways to change it that would improve things in typical cases-- but it's the behavior in malicious and rare cases that really define its performance.  Any kind of security measure is going to be worse on average than some less secure alternatives...

In any case, I dunno that I'd argue against a well studied change (-- though I'm not convinced that we even know what we don't know about this subject) including a correctly implemented change to more frequent updating (but maybe not *every* block), but now you've heard some of the points against it, as you requested.",nullc

1. You can't ban BTC itself because it's considered free speech. There's a precedent in US courts that has  found that code is 'free speech', so this is settled (albeit not at Supreme Court level yet - but Ninth is very high). ""Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that software source code was speech protected by the First Amendment and that the government's regulations preventing its publication were unconstitutional.""

2. AML Laws themselves are not really constitutional. There is no basis of suspicious or a warrant needed before your privacy is compromised by a government authority. Banks had no incentive to appeal these but the crypto community would.
3. TheY could sanction BTC... which is drastic and controversial. There's little evidence to say BTC itself is used for harmful purposes (to the degree that would justify sanctioning). It wouldn't be a popular political decision given the mass adoption and impression it sets on being anti-tech and anti-freedom. Unlikely.

They are most likely to continue regulating on and off ramps - i.e. regulating the exchanges that provide crypto services and ensuring they provide more information to government authorities. This shouldn't be that big a deal - once people have their BTC its outside of the government controls and into the users own hands. The government might ask for them to report each transaction but there will be other more anonymous means of acquiring BTC that avoid all these government controls (i.e. P2P).",inthearenareddit

gv8z352,1618952577,"I posted about this same concern about China last night. I think it‚Äôs a legitimate concern, maybe a very small chance but nonzero. Here‚Äôs how I think it could be a threat:

Currently greater than 51% of all mining is done in China. Given the power of the CCP over their companies, that means basically the CCP has an element of control over 51% of mining. 

Let‚Äôs say Bitcoin is a threat to the US dollar. China wants to weaken the dollar, so it allows / supports miners in its country with cheap electricity to allow Bitcoin to thrive within its borders. The USD is weakened sufficiently, and now Bitcoin is dominant.

But, now the CCP sees Bitcoin as a threat, not a weapon. It has served its purpose to them of crippling the USD. China now has its own digital Yuan that is centralized and controlled by the CCP, and that is threatened by Bitcoin dominance. 

So China ‚Äúpulls the plug‚Äù on Bitcoin, whatever that looks like - blocking electricity, confiscating equipment, forcing miners to create havoc by not approving transactions or by double-spending or with other ‚Äúdis-honest‚Äù (to use Satoshi‚Äôs terminology) behavior.

Again, I think this is very unlikely. But not impossible. And from what I‚Äôve read, the percentage of mining in China has been decreasing over time, so we may have more global security on the network as time goes on.",gozunker

gv910pz,1618953392,"In September last year, IBM announced that it was aiming to produce a quantum computer with 1000 qubits in 2023.

[IBM promises 1000-qubit quantum computer‚Äîa milestone‚Äîby 2023](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023)

&gt;Today, IBM made its aspirations more concrete by publicly announcing a ‚Äúroad map‚Äù for the development of its quantum computers, including the ambitious goal of building one containing 1000 qubits by 2023. IBM‚Äôs current largest quantum computer, revealed this month, contains 65 qubits.

The near-term impact of such quantum computers might not be significant on Bitcoin but there does appear to be one vulnerability that could be an issue according to this paper.

[Bitcoin and quantum computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04235)

&gt;Another possibility is that once a public key is revealed in a pending transaction, a malicious actor, Eve, with a quantum computer could steal the bitcoins before the transaction is finalized. In principal Eve only has 10 minutes to find the private key before the transaction is finalized. In practice bitcoin transactions often sit in an unofficial pending pool (the ‚Äúmem-pool‚Äù) for an hour or more.

Two different estimates of 1,500 or 2,330 qubits are quoted for the size of a quantum computer needed to do this. Therefore, it appears that publicly there are still a few years to go before quantum computers threaten Bitcoin. It is of course possible that non-publicly acknowledged quantum computers will reach that limit a few years earlier...

It is possible to change the encryption algorithm to something that a quantum computer can't (currently) break but that may only last until new quantum algorithms are developed. It could turn into a bit of an arms race if someone with a quantum computer really wanted to break Bitcoin.",AbbydonX

Banks discriminate against people of color and help keep the poor poor by charging them excessive fees. Banks steal money from their customers and abuse their trust to make more money. Banks take advantage of the system to make money that ordinary people cannot access, for example currency manipulation and IPOs. Banks manipulate interest rates and other mechanisms to make obscene amounts of money off the backs of working class people, and then don't even provide loans when needed at terms that are reasonable. They charge usury - obscene interest rates.  Banks foreclose on people and take their homes, putting families, children and old people on the street with nowhere to go, when they could exercise other options.  Banks have absurd anti-customer policies because they don't give a damn about keeping your business because they know you need them far more than they need you. I could go on.

The upside is that it ‚ÄòMight‚Äô eventually become an ETF or an open ended fund, in which case you could expect the discount to disappear.  

The downside is grayscale could just give a big FU to all shareholders and let the fees gradually consume the entire value of the fund until the stock is worth only a small fraction of NAV.

Starts at 11:18 if it doesn't link appropriately.

Has an interesting take on it that I hadn't heard before. Basically the signing algorithm is much more vulnerable than the sha256 hashing and keys. The signing algorithm is vulnerable because of the elliptic curve used. Goes on to mention that it could be patched and we're getting ready to see an example of a new signature type with Taproot upgrade.

Taproot will be the first newly added signature algorithm that will coexist with the old signing algorithm. It will use Schnorr signatures https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature

So if that's successful, then upgrading to a quantum resistant signing algorithm would go much the same way.

gv9nef3,1618963768,"This is the classic alt-coin dilemma ... VET is already at a $16 bn USD market cap ... question you're asking is how quickly can it 4x to get to that $1 you mention ... meaning it would have to be a $64 bn USD market cap.  Questions to ask:  is that realistic ... are there staking rewards that would also provide incentive to stay in VET, etc.  Do they have a pipeline of major brands lining up to use VET for their supply chain? 

I read that LVMH is going to use blockchain to ensure consumers can validate product authenticity, but I don't know whether they are using VET ... would be good to know who they are using if not VET.  

With a lot of institutional interest now that Bitcoin is over $1 T market cap, there may be a lot of groups out there ready to buy the dip(s).  Compare this to whether there is a similar group of people ready to buy the VET dips.  I'm having this same issue with another alt-coin that went down significantly, but doesn't have a large public awareness to help support it now that it's in dip mode.",PublicEmu

I and another party can create a multisig transaction on the blockchain with one input of 0.5 Bitcoin from my address.  5 years later, that other party and I can create a second multisig transaction with one input (the output from the previous transaction) and one output.  Nothing on either transaction makes any reference to the lightning network.  Bitcoins have just moved from A to B to C, with none of those addresses ever having been blacklisted or having transacted with a blacklisted address.

That combination may have allowed me to send and receive Bitcoin from to/from thousands of other addresses on the lightning network.  The blockchain has no knowledge of those other transactions.

I don't know what little dictatorship you have in mind where all addresses with channels on the Lightning network will be ""blacklisted"", but you can't tell from looking at the Blockchain which transactions open channels on Lightning, because Bitcoin knows nothing about Lightning.

So no way some other coin could call its self bitcoin right?

gva35y5,1618971939,"That's great to hear, but seriously do your research first and come up with your own investment thesis. Citibank (yep, the grand daddy bank) released a really good report on bitcoin last month (try searching for Citi Global Perspectives &amp; Solutions BTC) that's a great place to start because it's a group of incredibly intelligent people with backgrounds in financial economics and what not summarizing the technology, history, and major fud around it to just enough detail to get you on your way to other sources. Obviously, read the original white paper as well, and I'd highly suggest Max Keiser &amp; Stacy Herbert's 10 part youtube series ""To the Moon"" on their Orange Pill channel for a great history of BTC and cypherpunk. Paul Tudor Jones' investment thesis from last year is also really good, as is ""Layerd Money"" by Nik Bhatia.

If you don't do this due diligence, what is very likely to happen is next time BTC drops double digits after a new ATH - or goes into the next bear market at whatever price - you'll panic and sell, most likely at a loss.

gva38az,1618971976,"That‚Äôs a great question....hmm stability. I‚Äôm not a finance expert, but from what I understand, these companies are making money by making loans. I don‚Äôt mean the low interest 1% APY (seemingly too good to be true) loans Celsius offers to anyone (retail users) who‚Äôs deposited crypto with them. Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky said recently in a livestream AMA on Youtube that Celsius makes money because institutions borrow crypto from them. When you borrow crypto instead of USD, you can return crypto, and therefore don‚Äôt have to worry about the fluctuating price of the crypto. He said that these institutions will try to capitalize on the 2% spread between Coinbase and Binance (which is why I‚Äôd love to just use Binance, but Binance isn‚Äôt letting me in). I‚Äôm unclear on the logistics of how this spread situation works - maybe the borrowers take the crypto, sell it on Coinbase for more money while simultaneously buying crypto for less money on Binance...? Idk.

I‚Äôve tried googling this a bunch of times and the clearest answer I‚Äôve gotten is from Alex‚Äôs AMA, but he spent only like 45 seconds discussing it.

It‚Äôs obvious how the other companies make money (Blockfi, Nexo, Ledn, and Coinbase) - 

- Blockfi charges a 1% spread on both sells and buys, which is a pretty huge amount. Imagine if you had to pay 1% everytime you bought or sold a stock. 
- Nexo charges a spread, I think it‚Äôs 1%
- Coinbase Pro charges fees up to 0.5%, but as we know, a ton of trading happens there, unlike on, say, Blockfi
- Coinbase charges a fee (or a spread, can‚Äôt remember because I never use it to buy or sell) and it‚Äôs not as good a rate as Coinbase Pro

- Also, the yield vehicles (Blockfi, Nexo, and Ledn) offer high interest APY loans, far higher than Celsius.

Celsius is kind of a Robin Hood (NOT Robinhood) - which makes sense, given Alex Mashinsky‚Äôs track record. Apparently one of his other extremely successful companies was the one that made overseas phone calls free by putting phone call technology on the internet protocol (company is called VOIP?). They‚Äôre not making money on fees (though their partners are) or on high interest loans to the average user. Plus they pay for all gas/network fees when you make transfers - no one else does that.

Celsius says that their business model is stable because you have to have twice as much crypto as the amount in USD that you are borrowing. If the price of crypto drops too much, you will have to add more crypto to your account and/or they will sell some of your crypto. I think the other companies have something similar in place.

So I think as long as people/companies ARE taking loans, and loans ARE safely collateralized, and crypto stays a profitable sector to be in - which, considering the institutional adoption occurring this bull run, seems likely... I have no idea what will happen if next year is the predicted ‚Äúbear year‚Äù. 

Alex has said that Celsius is hugely profitable. We KNOW that Coinbase is extremely, extremely profitable - haha. Not sure about the others, but there‚Äôs just a ton of money in this space. It‚Äôs the adolescence of the new internet of money, right? 

As long as the companies are profitable, then they‚Äôre probably pretty stable. They‚Äôre going to keep competing with each other to offer more enticing deals and services, and they‚Äôll prioritize security. 

The scariest idea is that someone from inside one of these companies would try to steal all the crypto, but it seems unlikely - there‚Äôs probably enough money to be made already just running the businesses.

gva6dkr,1618973704,"Yes, the mechanics are the same. Even if demand comes in through futures, arbitrage should increase the spot price too.

The difference could be in the players and their objectives. Central Banks control the supply of gold, and they could have a vested interest in suppressing its price (and maybe other precious metals) to be able to say more convincingly there is no inflation (and they allegedly use derivatives to do that). Oil is controlled by nation states and transnational companies with different geopolitical goals, so incentives are not aligned between players, so it has a more ""legitimate"" market.

But that's a little bit of speculation on my part. With all that being said, I had a look at the market cap of silver, and it looks to be roughly 1.4 trillion USD. Now, you don't need another 1.4 trillion to, say, double the price of silver, probably much less than that. But as you said, SLV AUM is 15 billion, or a little over 1% of market cap...I am guessing not enough to ""squeeze"", especially when 21 billion is being mined every year.

gva9r8b,1618975661,"&gt;Then you hope it doesn't get lost in the mail. If you accidently sent it to the wrong address, good luck. You're never seeing that money again. 

The first problem, getting lost in the mail, is one bitcoin solves. Worst-case scenario is you've set the fee too low and need to send another transaction with a higher fee.

The second problem requires the sender to pay just a little bit of attention. Like if you're sending email to someone who's not already in your address book, you double-check the email address before hitting send. Same when sending to a bitcoin address that you've never sent funds to before.

Compared to the money lost every year by bank errors, account seizures, identity theft, and credit card fraud, I imagine ""wrong address"" losses are a drop in the bucket, even after adjusting for the difference in volume.

1. Setup the fallback upfront. That gets the clock ticking, and removes the incentive for miners to exploit a vulnerability that shouldn't have been added in the first place.
2. Give miners a veto, then when they use it, rush out a risky UASF late, putting the network in danger.

Cryptocurrency might be the most obvious thing of future ahead of us. The last thing that was making it uncertain, was probably the actual ability of crypto to be used for real, and we saw it this year. I agree with you there will be a pattern, but lets not fool ourselves in thinking everything is always the same. And i didnt mean to say that we wont go through a cycle, i meant to say that people's expectation changed and that it will shift the cycle differently, i dont know how tho, faster, slower? even more volatile or more stable? I dont mean to be able to predict it, i just mean that expecting it to be the same shape than before is probably foolish, the same way people were expecting bitcoin to fail before. Lets remember before it was a pattern, it was not, it was a unique event with the uncertainty that come with it, and people didnt expect it to be a pattern, they expected it to rise, or fall. Now, they expect it to move through a pattern, it feels like a mental trap to me.  
And again, i dont mean that to say that it will go down or high or whatever, just trying to dont fall for the comfort zone, it could slap hard in the back, even for people used to the volatility.

To maximize yield on BTC, you‚Äôd currently have to hold 2 on Celsius (6.2%), 2 on Ledn (6.1%), 1 on Blockfi (6%) and the rest on Nexo (4% or 5% APY if you enable their staking/hodl mode for a month at a time). 

Yeah It can be time consuming, plus APY rates are variable - and have slowly been going down over the last few months. 

But if you have that much BTC to spread out between all these platforms, you could seriously do this to maximize yield and live off of the passive income (depending on, of course, the price of BTC, your lifestyle expectation, and where in the world you live) - and while you‚Äôd have to pay taxes on the interest - you could take loans on Celsius at 1% APY to pay those taxes, never having to sell your crypto.

Your address for¬†Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based crypto assets changes every time you [receive](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006444193) a transaction. For other crypto assets (Ethereum, XRP, Stellar, etc.) the address stays the same.

Bitcoin transactions are public information. Addresses should not be re-used for¬†better privacy.¬†Ledger Live automatically generates new addresses using standards¬†([BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)/[BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)/[BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki)) and keeps track of your previous ones.¬†Previous addresses do remain valid, but they don't offer an optimal level of privacy.

## How it works

Each of your crypto assets accounts has an *extended public key*, called an **xpub**. From this extended public key all your public addresses for that account are generated. Thanks to the xpub you can receive transactions on a new address that belong to the same account.

You can find the xpub of an account in Ledger Live by clicking the wrench icon on the account page. In the **Edit account** window, check the **advanced logs**.¬†¬†",New_Honeydew_2013

gvaimvh,1618981485,"Desalination processes typically use high pressure to push water through filtration membranes, removing the salt and other impurities along the way. I can‚Äôt think of any existing plant that uses distilling as an effective process for desalination. It also requires a lot more heat energy than you might realize. Just because your usb stick was hot to the touch doesn‚Äôt mean it will evaporate water. Study up on enthalpy. In fact, grab a thermodynamics textbook and read the entire thing. Then think about all of the energy that would go to waste in the following process:

Fuel (sunlight/wind/gas) -&gt; electricity -&gt; Bitcoin mining -&gt; desalination

Or

Fuel (sunlight/wind/gas) -&gt; electricity -&gt; Bitcoin mining -&gt; heat engine -&gt; electricity 

At some point the entire process becomes so inefficient that the juice isn‚Äôt worth the squeeze. You should just desalinate using electricity or fuel directly, rather than spend the time, effort, money, and additional resources to build a contraption to capture waste heat. The only way any of this makes sense is if energy is free, and it currently is not. Not in economic terms. And certainly not in energy terms (see my suggestion to read a thermodynamics textbook).",optimoto

gvak4z9,1618982622,"To clarify what's happening with the video,

I did more research and found out that there is malware present on my computer that scans copy-pasted info that seems like BTC address (and/or Ethereum, but I haven't tested it out) and replaces it with their own BTC address. 

Apparently, this is a common occurrence. This is probably the reasoning behind every exchange asking you to double-check the recipient's address.

You might not even be aware that this malware is present on your computer. You might just be sending small amounts of crypto comparatively to your whole portfolio and didn't realize it never made it to your own address.

&amp;#x200B;

My Freiexchange BTC address is ""396SqVuKMZ5LSN2XYhAtvP9LQEDQWdAyAS""

but when I copy-pasted that into my BTC withdrawal section on Binance, it pasted the scammer's address. I only realized what happened when I checked my email and noticed it didn't match my Freiexchange address and thought I must've copied a different crypto deposit but networks can recognize if a specific deposit address only accepts BTC. So as I searched around Reddit and google, I found out that Trojan Malware exists on my computer :(

So now I lost all of the BTC that I bought from Binance and if you keep refreshing the scammer's address, they have taken a lot more than $500.

[blockchain.coinmarketcap.com/address/bitcoin/3KniJQ6YQyNAp3UW6ggYsoCtWjk9FyjUUC](https://blockchain.coinmarketcap.com/address/bitcoin/3KniJQ6YQyNAp3UW6ggYsoCtWjk9FyjUUC)

If you check their BTC address, you can see how many BTC deposits they've accumulated and transferred to their own personal wallets.

Be careful guys, now I know why every big market exchange has a warning about copy-pasting the correct address, a painful lesson for me but even worse for those who tried to transfer more than $10,000. :/",hayzsz

While that answer is certainly RELATED to my question.. it does not actually ANSWER my question... My question was whether they have the assets to back the purchases, and if there is a way to verify it.

I know they can commit fraud.. my question is ARE they committing fraud.. and is there a way to verify custody.

Based on answers above, it sounds like they openly admit there is no underlying asset backing the purchase. Which is what I ultimately wanted to understand. Since they openly admit it, they're not committing ""fraud"" per say.. but whatever it is you're buying when you use them -- it's not bitcoin.

Ultimately, obviously, this is bad for Bitcoin. Security issues aside, it means there are likely billions of dollars of bitcoin holdings out there that aren't actually bitcoin holdings. It makes me wonder what the CORRECT price of Bitcoin would be if this practice was made illegal.",exmobrian

You also don't understand how bitcoin works. The single transaction figure that you're parroting is also incorrect. Miners are using that energy to mine bitcoin. At the current value of bitcoin, miners are creating 50 million of dollars worth of the hardest money that's ever existed every single day. Think of it similar to gold mining, except bitcoin isn't even 10% as bad for the environment. The lightning network also uses a negligible amount of electricity and it's impossible to measure the amount of transactions that happen on it.

[Large scale bitcoin mining is driving clean energy innovation.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-large-scale-bitcoin-mining-is-driving-clean-energy-innovation-2021-01-06) Humans are using far too much dirty energy and people really need to address that issue and work on fixing it. Bitcoin has nothing to do with the world's dirty energy problem, and [""bitcoin mining is more renewables-driven than almost every other large-scale industry in the world.""](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/18/18642645/bitcoin-energy-price-renewable-china)

Bitcoin miners are able to get [clean renewable hydroelectric power for as low as 1 cent per kilowatt hour.](https://news.bitcoin.com/1-cent-per-kilowatt-hour-chinas-sichuan-province-encourages-hydro-powered-bitcoin-mining) 

Hydroelectric dams even create a large excess of electricity that otherwise goes to waste and [that waste is now used to mine bitcoin.](https://www.coindesk.com/chinese-city-known-for-bitcoin-mining-seeks-blockchain-firms-to-burn-excess-hydropower) 

Bitcoin is also [mined with energy created from gasses that are otherwise flared off or vented directly into the earth's atmosphere.](https://oilmanmagazine.com/how-and-why-natural-gas-flaring-is-being-used-to-mine-bitcoin/) 

Here's another article about [bitcoin mining using the electricity that would've been wasted.](https://news.bitcoin.com/how-big-hydro-power-partners-with-bitcoin-miners-to-prevent-energy-waste/)

The fact is, [**proof of work is efficient**.](https://www.danheld.com/blog/2019/1/5/pow-is-efficent) PoW is also secure when used in conjunction with bitcoin. This is why bitcoin is the most secure cryptocurrency that currently exists. This is why Tesla is comfortable storing billions of dollars worth of wealth in bitcoin.

**It would be great for the environment if humans used bitcoin as a store of value instead of gold.**

Gold is currently the #1 largest asset on earth by market cap because it's used by humans as a store of value and it has been for centuries. Bitcoin is a better store of value than gold and it's much easier send, protect, and hide and it's also more scarce than gold. Gold mining and transporting gold are both far worse for the environment than mining bitcoin and transporting bitcoin. Gold mining emits more than three times the co2 emissions than bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is more scarce than gold and bitcoin can also be used for payments and as currency and the lightning network allows an unlimited amount of people to send and receive bitcoin instantly for extremely low fees, and it can handle hundreds of millions of transactions per second. [Click here to see a list of the top 100 assets by market cap.](https://8marketcap.com/) Gold is #1 with a market cap of $11 trillion and bitcoin is #8 with a market cap of $1 trillion. Almost all of that value sitting in gold being inefficiently stored and guarded in vaults can more easily and efficiently be stored on the bitcoin blockchain and more people will continue to realize this as bitcoin continues to remain at the second stage of the evolution of money which is a store of value.

[**Watch this video to see bad mining gold is for the environment and you will be shocked.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzrJ9I3AJAQ)

Gold mining consumes multiple times more energy than bitcoin and is also quite toxic because of the chemicals needed to process the metal, let alone the costs of transportation and security. The gold miners dump toxic chemicals into the river where people bath. Bitcoin mining on the other hand is the greenest energy consumption sector. This is possible because the energy production has no geographic limitations so you could produce energy to mine bitcoin basically everywhere thanks to satellite internet connections. It would actually be great for the planet if we moved from gold to bitcoin as our main store of value.

This isn't the second millennium anymore and we have better technology now. Gold is just too inefficient and bad for the environment for people to be using as a store of value anymore and if we stopped doing that then the price would come down to it's true value and it would be extremely cheap for the minuscule amount that we do use in electronics, thus lowering the price of electronics. Gold is shiny and makes pretty jewelry and also makes great corrosion resistant semiconductors. It's difficult and expensive to transport and it requires equipment to reliably test it's authenticity. It's also difficult and expensive to adequately guard and protect. All of the value of gold could sit on the blockchain instead of sitting in a vault being guarded and it also wouldn't need to be transported in a jet in order to transfer it to someone.

Bitcoin's blockchain is layer 1 and is used for large payments/settlements/transactions. Bitcoin will not sacrifice the security of it's blockchain for any reason. The lightning network is one of bitcoin's layer 2 solutions and it's used for smaller instant payments/transactions. People are transferring $500M+ worth of bitcoin, often over a $billion worth of bitcoin, [in every single block](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks), all day, every day. The lightning network can handle an unlimited amount of users and hundreds of millions of transactions per second which is magnitudes more transactions than visa/mastercard can handle. 

Bitcoin is currently in the second stage of the evolution of money, which is a store of value. [Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ma1y9b/40_yr_old_new_to_crypto/grra6s5/) to see all four stages. Bitcoin is going through price discovery, and every asset is volatile during price discovery. Bitcoin will remain volatile until it's true value is found. Over 99.9999% of people don't understand bitcoin and most people don't even really understand money. As time goes on, more smart people learn about and begin to understand bitcoin. More people will continue to adopt bitcoin because it's a superior store of value.",daymonhandz

The idea of crypto currency, (especially the NFT type of things appearing in this stage of the game) is to make a virtual asset that is unique and not able to be duplicated in the virtual world. This goes over most peoples heads, since days of old if you wanted two of something in a virtual place then you just copy it, the idea that that is impossible for Blockchain technology is lost on people who are not technologically literate enough to change their perspective of being able to achieve a truly unique digital fingerprint.

Bitcoin's block chain approach has paved way for that premise in HUGE strides, sure it has its problems, but look at all the new improved security and unique fingerprinting tech that has come from it, you can literally get collectors card NFT's now, no two are the same ever.

It is believed that only a few people own the majority of the currency. In such a case, these people have enormous power over the currency. Put yourself in the shoes of the governments, this is a problem for national security. No relevant government will allow something like bitcoin, let alone replace it with its own currency. The fact that people are emotionally invested in it should make you think. You can gloss over it as you like, but in the end everyone is only in there to make money, and if the big holders sell their shares, the supply will be too big to make up for by buying. Just because some famous people have invested in it doesn't mean anything. If you think that so many can't be wrong then think of the people who believe that the earth is flat IN 2021.

I wont be selling or spending any of my bitcoins for at least two more block reward halvings. After that I will be more willing to trade some of my bitcoin for material possessions that I truly desire and that will increase my quality of life, whether that means buying directly with bitcoin or trading into whichever currency allows me to buy said material possessions at that time. 97% of bitcoin will be mined by 2032, so bitcoins are going to be very scarce.

Chinese hydroelectric power plants are popular spots for bitcoin mining. While China cracks down on the industry, 61% of bitcoin mining is powered by fossil fuels.

Miners are willing to move anywhere for residual energy, increasing the profitability of natural gas in Siberia and supporting oil drilling in Texas.

In Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, bitcoin miners are getting special access to cheap, clean energy produced by an EU-funded hydroelectric plant. The plant was designed to help locals find livelihoods beyond poaching and stop them resorting to scouring parkland for wood fuel.

gvau0wi,1618991058,"Let's first bust the myth of 'inherent value'. There's no such thing. Value is fundamentally the result of a supply and demand equation. There is no law of the universe saying you can exchange a gold coin for 20 coconuts if the guy selling coconuts prefers silver. The closest thing in history any currency has come to having inherent value is salt, because everyone has to have it to live. But even then, a bag of salt is worth way less at the mine than in the middle of the desert because scarcity affects the supply and demand aspects of the value equation. 

The next thing to talk about here is the real purpose of currency. The original reason currencies were established was to solve a problem that exists in bartering based economies called the 'double-coincidence of wants'. Basically, if I come to market with turnips, and you come to market with yams, you have to want turnips AND I have to want yams before trade can occur. This can become a problem and unbalance economies if some resource becomes too plentiful or too scarce. Currency gives everyone at least one thing they will (almost) certainly want, eliminating one half of the double coincidence problem. 

Modern day fiat currencies have value because the government said so, to make a long story short. Originally this was backed up by their being willing to exchange gold for fiat, but that's long past now. But by the time that was phased out, enough people had bought into that system that it was able to survive under its own merits. Basically, too many people use the fiat based system now for a company to survive outside of it. But at its most fundamental level, fiat's value is still derived from someone saying these strips of dyed cotton have value and everyone else agreeing to play along. 

Enter Bitcoin. Bitcoin came along and said, 'Hey what if we agreed to exchange things with these digital tokens instead of strips of paper or plastic owned by corporations and governments?' And enough people thought that was a good idea that Bitcoin now also has value. It's true that Bitcoin only has value because people agree that it does, and that its value is derived from the supply and demand equation, but those same things are true of every other currency and object in existence. 

Bitcoin also practically solves one problem that has existed as long as currency has been a thing: counterfeiting. In simple terms, to counterfeit a bitcoin, you have to convince more than half of the people recording its transactions that you spent it somewhere you didn't. The problem with this comes from the fact that doing so requires more resources than a bitcoin is actually worth. Its less cost effective to counterfeit a bitcoin than it would be to simply spend it legitimately.

The last thing to address here is the market manipulation concern. While this is a legitimate concern, for now, the more  commonly accepted and adopted Bitcoin becomes, the less damage any person or group will be capable of doing. But even now, in a similar way to the counterfeit problem above, it's not truly in anyone's best interest to attempt to tank bitcoins price. A person or group might dump billions of dollars worth of bitcoin, causing a large dip in its price, but at the end of all that, they would be out billions of dollars, and a lot of other people would have acquired Bitcoin on the cheap. The price would eventually recover, and the network would keep on moving.",LosWafflos

Its also completely disingenuous to look at the current state and extrapolate from that. Their own numbers show that miners still spend much more on equipment than energy. That wont last. This is only because there is a shortage of mining hardware, and because until recently, hardware became obsolete very soon. Neither will last. Most recent bitcoin miners are reaching the technological limits of chip manufacturing, they will not be obsoleted in 6 months, maybe not 6 years. That means the cost structure will shift towards energy making mining with expensive energy uneconomical and intermittent mining with free electricity much more profitable.

gvav3to,1618992111,"Unless we're talking about a 51% attack, which is becoming more and more unlikely, hash rate by itself doesn't give you control of the network. The protocol adjusts the average time a new block is mined, so a drop off in hash rate would lead to a lower difficulty for the remaining miners. Effectively, less miners would then mine more coins than they did before, and the average mining rate would remain unchanged.

But that doesn't even need to happen now, as most miners in China will be back soon enough or are already back online.

There's many supposed reasons for the price drop, the hashrate is only one of them, and technically the hashrate drop itself didn't cause the price to drop, there's no direct correlation between price and hashrate.

So, if we even consider the hashrate drop as the main event leading to the drop, it's more about people being unreasonably worried about the drop due to rumors rather than the drop itself that is responsible.

Chances are, it just dropped because it was time for a correction after the massive bull runs in the past month.

So no, I'm not really worried about it, not any more than I've been before this event, as China has always had a huge chunk of hashrate, but in the past years that number decreased, and its only going to decrease further once more countries get into the mining pools.

Due your own due diligence and research how much gold has stayed in the same institutions for years. The only way they ever used it since their inception has been to leverage it for cash flow to invest in income producing assets and businesses. Leverage doesn‚Äôt mean sell by the way, that just means allowing a bank to hold your gold temporarily for a loan that whatever you invest in will pay off over time. Then Search the Chinese  gold leverage fraud from 2018 where they discovered leveraged gold that was found to be counterfeit years later after the loan was issued for it and the money from the loan spent. This is why gold is going to zero, because it‚Äôs being replaced by a digital gold with all its qualities that have held it king for thousands of years and more.

gvaw6y1,1618993181,"These are not new criticisms and everyone here has already considered them.

Anyone who thinks that the property, financial, stock or derivatives markets are based as much on 'real' things clearly hasn't been paying attention to those markets over the last hundred years.  Time and again property assets, financial assets, stocks and derivatives have been shown to be completely hollow.

No national currency anywhere, as others have mentioned, is backed by anything anymore.  It's all a debt-based shell game which everyone had to buy into because there was nothing else on offer.

Bitcoin blazes the trail to provide that something else.  It is money.  It is a store of wealth.  But beyond those facts, it has qualities that make it stand apart.

It is trustless.  Banks and other financial institutions are closed, opaque managers of data which represents money.  You have to trust them.  When someone taps a debit card at your checkout, you trust your bank when they tell you that you will get your $20 sometime in the future.  Your bank trusts Visa or Mastercard or whoever it is.  With Bitcoin you don't have to trust anyone.  You can see the ledger.  You can see that the address has the funds to send you.  You can see that they sent those funds to you.  You can see that they are not doublespending.

It is uncensorable.  You can send your coins to anyone you want.  Visa and the others decide who you can pay.  They can restrict payments for political reasons.  Like when they stopped processing donations to wikileaks.  They might stop payments to a particular country where they have concerns about the reliability of the financial system there.  Bitcoin doesn't care who is transacting with whom.

It facilitates instant transactions.  People compare the speed of onchain transactions with Visa and say things like ""who will wait in the shop for hours for their payment to clear"".  This misses a number of fundamental points.  Getting a happy bing from the card machine in the store doesn't mean the retailer has received your money.  It tells the retailer that you have the money to spend, and for a few bucks the banks will deposit the money in hos account sometime in the future, until then the retailer has no access to the money.  Compare that to Lightning on Bitcoin.  The bing happens just as quickly, but signifies that the money has already gone from your wallet to the retailer's, who can immediately spend it if they need to.

Bitcoin faciliates streaming money, again implemented on Lightning.  Think of pay per view video.  Instead of paying $x up front to watch an event.  You can pay *by the second* as you watch.  The performer receives the money *by the second*.  Not only is this fair to everyone, it also provides instant feedback to the performer who can adapt in real time to keep people watching.  Streaming can also apply in the real world.  Paying in realtime for the water flowing through your tap.  

Nobody can say for certain who has how many bitcoin, but it's pretty clear that many of the ""1% of the 1%"" don't, because for each of them to hold a good chunk, they would have had to have bought those chunks.  And if they had done that, the price would be multiples of what it is now.

I'd like to point out that this is how the difficulty adjustment is done.

This means that the first two weeks (or just less then that) the difficulty is actually set too low, and we get an average block time of just under 10 minutes. The opposite is true for when hashrate gets removed from the network. However, hashrate has been increasing way more often than decreasing, so the average historical block time is under 10 minutes.

Inherent value means that the money has a value independent of its use as money. That value is also determined by supply and demand but that demand is for non-monetary use.

&gt;Modern day fiat currencies have value because the government said so, to make a long story short. 

It's slightly more complicated than that as the value is produced due to the requirement to pay taxes in the government currency (i.e. [chartalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartalism)). Effectively the currency is used to extinguish a debt (i.e. tax liability) which is consistent with the [credit theory of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_theory_of_money).

Most amusingly is the following [quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard#Abandonment_of_the_gold_standard):

In my own country, we successfully cooperated with our central bank in regulating Bitcoin/crypto businesses starting from 2014 up to present. In fact, my company was one of the first in our country to receive a ""Virtual Currency Exchange"" license, which allowed us to work with banks and legitimize the entire industry today. This is what was written in the introduction to the guidelines: 

*""Thus, the Bangko Sentral recognizes that Virtual Currency (VC) systems have the potential to revolutionize delivery of financial services, particularly for payments and remittance, in view of their ability to provide faster and more economical transfer of funds, both domestic and international, and may further support financial inclusion. These benefits, however, should be considered along with the corresponding risks in VCs considering the higher degree of anonymity involved, the velocity of transactions, volatility of prices and global accessibility. In particular, VCs pose ML and TF risks, information technology risks, and consumer protection and financial stability concerns, among others.""*

You concern is valid, but governments are not going to ban Bitcoin. That threat has already been addresses many times.

gvb1j0k,1618998367,"&gt;I really think you should try to read about it from sources that are uninterested in bitcoin

You mean sources who do not understand the very peculiar dynamics of the crypto mining market and the semiconductor industry?

Ive been at this for some time and even most (especially non professional) miners do not understand it; most have wasted fortunes buying ""mining bonds"" or preordering equipment that can never pay itself back,  or have and continue to happily mine at a loss, spending 1 bitcoin (or equivalent dollar amount) to mine 0.5 bitcoin and thinking it is profitable, just because bitcoin tripled in value during that time.Precious few people truly understand this market and I have no reason to believe [earth.org](https://earth.org) does.

And yes, I dare say I do, I have a background in the semiconductor industry, Ive mined some bitcoins on GPUs in 2011 until I retired and never even ordered an asic as I was among the first to predict the dynamics of asic mining and the impact of generational order of magnitude improvements of die shrinks from 20 year old process nodes to state of the art process nodes. In short:  prices would be set by the biggest fools and as a result all profits would go to some asic manufacturers, no *bitcoin denominated* profits for most ordinary miners for years or decades to come.  I was right, even if the biggest fools still dont realise it.

And we have not seen the end of that transition, where mining hardware production rates and difficulty/mining revenue finds an equilibrium. Only then will you really see the truth of my carbon footprint arguments, and its not going to take another decade. Bitcoin price cant keep tenfolding every 2 years forever, mining hardware can not keep doubling in efficiency every other year, its already using more advanced process nodes than intel or AMD, blockreward keeps going down. The end is in sight and some of your own examples already demonstrate the inherent truth of my argument.",Vertigo722

gvb6wtz,1619003072, The Bitcoin price fell by approximately 18% over the weekend and one of  the factors behind this drop was a power outage in China‚Äôs Xinjiang  region that caused a 45% drop in the hash rate.  The hash rate of Bitcoin measures the total combined computational power  that is being used to mine and process the cryptocurrency.   Another factor behind Bitcoin‚Äôs price dive was speculation that the U.S.  Treasury would charge several financial institutions with money  laundering using cryptocurrencies.

IOW, you will make substantially more (or lose substantially less) by simply buying bitcoin. 

To explain the dynamics in detail would require writing a novel, but the fact even most miners do not understand this, and unwittingly mine at a (bitcoin denominated loss), is exactly why it continues to hold true, as mining is a zero sum game where the overall profitability is determined by the biggest suckers.",Vertigo722

Yes bitcoin is really decentralized. Bitcoin mining will always become concentrated in locations that have cheap electricity available, and that's the way bitcoin was designed to work.

Nah, in most countries they are not. 

For 5000 years and more humans have been able to own their own money. Some think it is a human right to be able to own the money you get paid for the work you have done. 
Bitcoin makes personal digital ownership possible.

When you create a bitcoinaddress only you will have the digital keys to it, meaning only you can sign a transaction from it.
Meaning any coins sent to it will be fully yours.
 
Unlike a bank account, which the bank owns and you need their willingness and consent to open and use it anyone can create one or more bitcoin addresses for free.

And unlike a bank account in which the money their customers see on the account is not really reserved. It is actually a promise a so called IOU you see on your computer screen.
Banks only keep 3-5% of their customers total money in reserve the rest is lent out or used for speculation.

If you have your coins in an address you created.

gvbbb6k,1619006289,"&gt; Why do we believe Coinbase has Bitcoin in their custody that equals the amount their customers hold?

I do not believe this. It's their reputation at stake. So if you believe their reputation is valuable enough, you're good. If not,... 

&gt; Why do we believe RobinHood, Venmo, etc. are in possession of any Bitcoin at all, since it can't be transferred off their network?

There's a general consensus on this forum to call these kind of exclusive custodial bitcoin services 'paper bitcoin'. You don't have bitcoin, you have a derivative with a promissory note to follow the USD valuation of bitcoin. 

&gt;What is stopping these guys from selling counterfeit coin, like a giant Ponzi scheme?

Their reputation. If they think they can get away with it, and have a great exit plan set up, there's nothing really stopping them. If they have more to loose then they have to gain,.... then its a potential issue. 

Selling counterfeit coin is not a ponzi scheme, in a ponzi scheme you use money from new investors to pay out gains to older investors. If you sell paper money, you can make as much of it as you want and don't need new investors to keep going (look at the federal government).",ElephantsAreHeavy

Transaction batching is used to make multiple payments with a single on-chain transaction / fee. This can also be used to fund multiple channels simultaneously. The main problem here is that you need to coordinate the funding process for all channels in parallel, so I don't think too many wallets support it yet.

There are also channel factories. I recommend checking out this explanation of how they work (although I believe it depends on Taproot and some other protocol upgrades first):

In a Bear Market, the best thing to do is to accumulate more BTC, or at least wait. You need to take a long-term view of Bitcoin. This will help you take full advantage of it.

The hardest part is when the price of Bitcoin goes up sharply.

Everyone is talking about taking profits and will do anything to take the BTC you have been holding for months or years.

This is when you need to keep a cool head and continue to make decisions based on your logical thinking.

While miners do hodl some of the BTC they own, in anticipation of higher prices in the future, at some point they *have* to sell them. Either sell them for fiat, to be able to use this fiat to pay for the equipment and power, or ""sell"" them directly in exchange for said equipment/power.

I'll eventually delete this reddit account so I'm alright with minor transparency here to give you my perspective.

I bought BTC when BTCUSD was around 50-200 and completely missed ~~2017~~ every ATH because I forgot about it. ~3000USD in BTC wasn't enough to pay off a combined total of 5 figures of debt, but it was safe from garnishment. This was all I had to my name until the debt made me homeless, but nobody cared about my BTC wallets. Interesting.

Eventually homelessness made me forget about my BTC and I missed the 2017 ATH which would be $700k (at 20k BTCUSD).

At 60k, I still cannot justify selling for $2m. I have no goal or endgame and I'd be alright with taxes if I did cash out honestly. It's because that amount of money will forever kill people like me.

I'm a recovering addict.

* [cbase help](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/cryptocurrency-trading-pairs/how-to-send-and-receive-cryptocurrency)

* [bitcoin guide](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/sending)

Don't enter into this space blindly.  Give it the same amount of study you would for a college chemistry class.

That being said, the simplest answer is:

1. Go to Trezor and get a receive address (copy it down)
2. Go to Coinbase and start a send transaction
3. Enter the address you copied down ensuring copy fidelity
4. Acknowledge the fee for withdraw
5. Clean up the coffee you spat out when you saw the fee
6. Confirm the withdraw
7. Go back to Trezor to look for withdraw
8. Wait between 10 seconds and 72 hours for withdraw to broadcast
9. Wait between 10 minutes and 336 hours for withdraw to confirm

Yeah that is pretty terrible. Its one of the reasons I support crypto. 


&gt;short selling is similiar.

No it isn't. Short selling is borrowing an asset, selling it then buying it back later to return to the lender plus interest. That is not similar to attempting to corner a market (with or without government support) and then imposing your will on everyone. They are completely different things. 

If I lend you bitcoin to buy a house and have in the contract you must pay me back in bitcoin then you would be short selling bitcoin for a house. I think that would be dumb due to the possibility of bitcoin growing faster than you can pay it back (just as it is dumb to short bitcoin over a long timeframe or any volatile asset) But its not something I would ban or could ban for bitcoin (you could do it with say onion futures because its a highly controlled market and you cant lend onions over the internet but the ban on onion futures has not helped the volatility of onion prices again it is just another volatile asset with people mistaking forward sales in this case for their own bad trades or for being outsmarted that one time).",JonnyLatte

He can go to a futures market and try to find a buyer who will agree to pay 50,000 for his bitcoin in 6 months.   Now the miner is protected from price drops in 6 months but he also can't make any gains in the event the price shoots up above 50,000.

gvbkv92,1619011850,"&gt; I know that there are certain things that make mining harder and more expensive with the time. Could you please explain it in a simple not too technical way?

Bitcoin mining is a guessing game. The game is designed to create a 10-minute delay between Bitcoin blocks. This means that Bitcoin miners create 144 blocks per day. At the current reward amount, that means 900BTC per day  

Bitcoin mining is a folly of diminishing returns. If more miners join the Bitcoin mining network, they cause the reward per miner to fall, for all miners, including themselves  

&gt; Are there any events in 2021 that will make it harder or more expensive for miners to mine Bitcoin? Could there be such a big inflow of competition that the mining expense rises drastically from today?

The COVID pandemic caused chip production factories in Taiwan to close down. There is now a world-wide chip shortage. The chip shortage means a Bitcoin miner ASIC device shortage. If you order a Bitcoin miner today, you might be waiting until October to receive it  

At the same time the manufacturing capacity collapsed, the Bitcoin price increased from $10.6k to $55k. Price increases usually attract more miners  

When the manufacturing capacity recovers, there is a huge backlog of demand from miners wanting to profit from the price increase. This will squeeze Bitcoin mining profit margins to near zero  

You should have bought your miners in Aug 2020, before the manufacturing shortage, before the crazy price increase. You would be making big profits right now",igadjeed
gvbkvvu,1619011859,"Some best practices, what they mean, and why you need to do them:

""Not your keys, not your bitcoin!"" This means you need to have control over the keys that enable you to spend bitcoin from an address. If your money is stored with a user account on an unregulated company, they can just steal it. Or be hacked. Or an insider can run with it.

You should have a hardware wallet like a Trezor, ColdCard, or BitBox02. Not a wallet on your phone or computer (unless it's a lightning wallet you put only small amounts of money in). Hardware wallets are generally a keychain storing your keys on a device that's not connected to the internet. You can't easily be hacked. A hardware wallet gives you a 24-word passphrase. NEVER store those words in any digital form (no screenshot, no text file, nothing!). Write them down, laminate the paper and store it safely and securely. Even better, punch them into a stainless steel card so it can't burn or be otherwise destroyed.

Always add a (long, remembered) personal password as a 25th word to your seed phrase. Don't write that one down. If you don't do that and someone finds those 24 seed phrase, they can spend your bitcoin.

When you buy bitcoin, pay them when you see at least one confirmation on a block explorer. When it is much money, wait at least for 3 confirmations before you pay. Never pay without confirmation. Every honest seller will understand this practice. Take care that the seller pays the correct blockchain fee (you can easily look up what the fee should be on a site like mempool.space).

Don't reuse addresses. The wallet can give you a new address for every new transaction. This is for your own safety and privacy.

If you don't understand what i mean by all this, please ask. :)",casual_hasher

I keep a small balance in USD in my bank account because my mortgage and bills autopay from there. When they autopay, I replenish the account through sending a lightning payment to Strike and withdrawing to that bank account. I built a little system to track these micro transactions for taxes (though I am rooting for a de minimis law to get passed soon).

Because we‚Äôre in the middle of an epic bull run, I opened a few 0 APR cards to put expenses on so that I can hodl as much BTC as possible until next year. 

After I max out the 0 APR cards, if they won‚Äôt give me more, I‚Äôll carry debt on my other cards until the fall. I‚Äôm expecting from a number of places that Bitcoin will hit $300k. 

Probably what I will do at that point is sell a small portion of my stack and become totally debt free (pay off my small house, pay off the cards). If Bitcoin enters a bear market, this will help me get through that psychologically, and I may even sell the house and rent during the bear, allowing me stack more sats. If Bitcoin has a super cycle, I‚Äôll miss out on the upside of the portion I sold, but it will have been just a portion of my stack and it will have been insurance I didn‚Äôt need to collect on, and hyperbitcoinization will be imminent, so things will be good.

The only issue is that doing so requires a hard fork.

If you aren‚Äôt tech savvy then a cold wallet is probably more complication than you need. 

General internet safety is what you need here:
- spread your funds between multiple accounts
- use strong passwords (20+ chars) that aren‚Äôt reused anywhere else (I always recommend using a password manager)
- consider creating a new email address that you only use for crypto. Often your main email address is already leaked (see haveibeenpwned)
- don‚Äôt tell anyone how much you have or where you‚Äôve placed it
- setup 2fa (2 factor authentication) on your accounts, email, etc (make sure your phone account is secure - google simjacking to learn more)

gvbyvn3,1619018365,"&gt; why is this bad? you can still use a paper backup. SD is convenient because you can encrypt it and put it in a bank vault or anywhere else that you don't control. The coldcard does the same and its a great way to increase your robustness.

you cannot encrypt the SD card with Bitbox02

&gt; How is it an attack vector?

It's an additional backup of your seed. If you don't need it, you shouldn't need to create an SD card backup. Even if you erase your SD card, there is at least a theoretical risk that someone might be able to recover it. Any risk that does not provide any benefit to the end user should not be taken.

&gt; Why is this not secure?

I am not a security expert, but from what I can tell, it's always better to have a smaller attack surface. Ledger doesn't even have the ability to export the seed phrase after the setup, thus this function cannot be abused.",ComprehensiveHalf295

Modern SSDs can do tens of thousands of I/O operations per second, so looking up UTxOs from disk is plenty fast enough to match Visa's peak transaction rate.

The issue is network bandwidth. Believe it or not, there are still large fractions of the world's population that lack access to broadband Internet connectivity. Downloading 1 MB every 10 minutes is doable for them, but anything more is really straining the limits of their connection.

Keep in mind that most bank deposits are also made using electronic private bank money not cash. This money was also created when someone took a loan. However, when it is used to pay for goods and services it is just transferred to another bank account. This might even be with the same bank leading to no net change in the bank's position. This is why savings don't increase the deposits or funds available for banks to lend.

gvc1tum,1619019629,"First of all, this is amazing.  Thank you so much. I do have some questions/comments though and was wondering if you could clear them up.  Note that all price calculations I'm talking about here are in USD (Cell C1 is set to USD).

* My Purchase History worksheet looks much different than yours in your screen shots. I don't have separate headings for separate Cryptos, rather it's all one list.
* On my purchase history worksheet as downloaded from your dropbox, there appears to be a directly assigned value of ""1"" in Cell C14.  This gets added to the last cumulative purchase value cell from H13, so the total for Cell H14 gets 1 added to it for some reason. Is this an error?  Can you explain this? I changed the ""1"" to ""0"" and it doesn't seem to have hurt anything, I assume I could also just remove it and make H14 pull the value from H13 directly, unless the ""1"" in C14 is being used elsewhere for some reason?
* Likewise Current Value Cell I14 is directly assigned a value of ""0.001"". Is this supposed to be like that?
* On the purchase history sheet, there is conflicting information about how to handle sells.  The green instructions say to list it as a negative amount, but you have two different examples of this. Row 12 has a negative value in the price paid **and** the amount bought/sold (-500 in C12, and -0.1 in F12). Row 13 has a negative value in the price paid **but** a positive value in the amount bought/sold (-50 in C13, and +0.001 in F13).  Which is the correct way to record it?
* The above bullet also relates to how the ""cumulative purchase value"" and ""cumulative current value"" are calculated, and I assume also affects how the ""Total if HODLed"" and ""Trading gain/loss"" are calculated on the Portfolio page. I want to make sure I get this right.  Making Column ""F"" a negative value subtracts the current value from the previous Cummulative current value total, while making Column ""F"" positive adds to the Cummulative current value, which doesn't make sense if you are selling something (basically counts it twice... once when you bought it and once when you sold it).
* The regret calculator doesn't appear to be working correctly for me. To test, I put $100 investment and the purchase date as 1 day ago, and it's coming up as $569 value today.  I'm fairly certain BTC hasn't risen 5.69x in a day.   
* You have some portfolio history charts in your screenshots that I don't have in my copy that I downloaded.

Everytime the price is deceasing, all media is saying the bull market is over and technical analysts say we're going to test the 20 day moving average at $44k.

Nobody knows but all the variables for a strong future are still in place. We have record low btc on exchanges from long term whales moving coin to storage. From April 17-19, a record 103,000 btc were transferred off exchanges. Miners are not selling coins because they think the price will be increasing. The rate of new accounts on exchanges is growing. The daily demand is exceeding the daily bitcoin mined. Institutions have purchased signficant amounts of btc and the number is growing. The economy is entering an inflationary period and investors want hedges for their cash, with btc being the perfect digital bank account to house it. The overall stock market is hitting all time highs, so BTC at the least will keep up with that. Other coins skyrocketed this last month, people will be looking to convert to BTC.

The most likely reason for the recent prices is whales controlling the market to their benefit and buyers moving into other coins. Pressure is used to liquidate longs and shorts to maximize profits and coin by the whales. Manupulation is used to control price for greater accumulation.

I'm not an expert so I can't speculate as to why they keep buying gold, other than for a hedge against their own currency inflation, etc.

But soon enough there will be a central bank / nation state that accepts Bitcoin and is willing to hold it. First individual people join the network, people willing to throw their savings into it and  sell their houses for it (us!). Then corporations will be willing to hold it on their balance sheets, and accept it as payments for their goods (Tesla!).

Your main error is that you see bitcoin as just another ""currency"" which it is not. When a transaction is completed value is transferred from buyer to seller with both being satisfied no matter what the commodity exchanged for bitcoin is, whether a pizza or a Tesla.

Hodler's are simply delaying the purchase of the pizza or Tesla until later, when value is more equitable. Why should I buy a Tesla for one bitcoin today when I can get one for a half a coin in a year? But at some point I will see equitable value.

Bitcoin is scarce tokenized derivative of inflation and corruption that's kept honest and secure by it's own decentralized ledger of value that can't be forged or hacked. Bitcoin is finite and the protocol allows online bitcoin payments to be sent from one user to another without requiring trust or permission from anyone else. But bitcoin is also more than just money. Bitcoin technology is constantly being developed, and so much is happening. We're switching to schnorr signatures and activating taproot this year. NFTs can be done on bitcoin and that's where they were done first back in 2012. There's also new discreet log contracts, RGB, musig2, coinswap, smart contracts, and various sidechains in development, including liquid network. We should also have trustless cross chain atomic swaps available this year. Taproot will make it so nobody can tell if a multi-signature transaction or an atomic swap has taken place by looking at a transaction on the blockchain. Schnorr signatures allows us to have point time lock contracts. RGB allows smart contracts to be done using bitcoin. And much more!

Gold is currently the #1 largest asset on earth by market cap because it's used by humans as a store of value and it has been for centuries. Bitcoin is a better store of value than gold and it's much easier send, protect, and hide and it's also more scarce than gold. Gold mining and transporting gold are both far worse for the environment than mining bitcoin and transporting bitcoin. Gold mining emits more than three times the co2 emissions than bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is more scarce than gold and bitcoin can also be used for payments and as currency and the lightning network allows an unlimited amount of people to send and receive bitcoin instantly for extremely low fees, and it can handle hundreds of millions of transactions per second. [Click here to see a list of the top 100 assets by market cap.](https://8marketcap.com/) Gold is #1 with a market cap of $11 trillion and bitcoin is #8 with a market cap of $1 trillion. Almost all of that value sitting in gold being inefficiently stored and guarded in vaults can more easily and efficiently be stored on the bitcoin blockchain and more people will continue to realize this as bitcoin continues to remain at the second stage of the evolution of money which is a store of value.

This isn't the second millennium anymore and we have better technology now. Gold is just too inefficient and bad for the environment for people to be using as a store of value anymore and if we stopped doing that then the price would come down to it's true value and it would be extremely cheap for the minuscule amount that we do use in electronics, thus lowering the price of electronics. Gold is shiny and makes pretty jewelry and also makes great corrosion resistant semiconductors. It's difficult and expensive to transport and it requires equipment to reliably test it's authenticity. It's also difficult and expensive to adequately guard and protect. All of the value of gold could sit on the blockchain instead of sitting in a vault being guarded and it also wouldn't need to be transported in a jet in order to transfer it to someone.

Bitcoin's blockchain is layer 1 and is used for large payments/settlements/transactions. Bitcoin will not sacrifice the security of it's blockchain for any reason. The lightning network is one of bitcoin's layer 2 solutions and it's used for smaller instant payments/transactions. People are transferring $500M+ worth of bitcoin, often over a $billion worth of bitcoin, [in every single block](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks), all day, every day. The lightning network can handle an unlimited amount of users and hundreds of millions of transactions per second which is magnitudes more transactions than visa/mastercard can handle. 

Bitcoin is currently in the second stage of the evolution of money, which is a store of value. [Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ma1y9b/40_yr_old_new_to_crypto/grra6s5/) to see all four stages. Bitcoin is going through price discovery, and every asset is volatile during price discovery. Bitcoin will remain volatile until it's true value is found, which I expect to be at 7 digits of US dollars. Over 99.9999% of people don't understand bitcoin and most people don't even really understand money. As time goes on, more smart people learn about and begin to understand bitcoin. More people will continue to adopt bitcoin because it's a superior store of value.

[Proof of work is efficient](https://www.danheld.com/blog/2019/1/5/pow-is-efficent) and PoW is secure when used in conjunction with bitcoin. This is why bitcoin is the most secure cryptocurrency that currently exists. This is why companies are okay storing billions of dollars worth of wealth in bitcoin. This is also why I feel safe storing most of my wealth in bitcoin.

Most importantly, here's the [bitcoin whitepaper](https://fermatslibrary.com/s/bitcoin) and that website also explains each part of it.

Over 99% of altcoins were created to enrich their founders and over 99% of them have no future. None of them are as secure, as decentralized, or launched as fairly as bitcoin. Satoshi created bitcoin to allow online payments to be sent directly from one person to another without requiring trust or permission of anyone else. Satoshi and bitcoin had no premine, no developer fund, no developer fund, no developer tax, never sold, no profit, no fame for his real identity, removed himself from the project, no leader, and he gave a two month heads up about before he launched bitcoin. Bitcoin is also decentralized and trustless with the nodes in full control, and there's no central leader. Cryptocurrency is full of scammers/grifters, ignorance, and people that actually believe the lies because they've been sucked into shitcoin cults. Gamblers use altcoins for trading/gambling to increase their bitcoin stack or even their [ethereum stack if they don't understand bitcoin and cryptocurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T89gsJ2MsG8&amp;feature=youtu.be). **Gambling on altcoins can still be very profitable during a bull run** and you can increase your bitcoin stack by a lot. 

Satoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that bitcoin was launched fairly:

* **Bitcoin didn't have a premine** (Satoshi didn‚Äôt grant himself any coins)

* **Satoshi gave a 2 month heads up before launching bitcoin** (no secret mining or sudden release)

* **Bitcoins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely** (this cannot even be replicated)

* **Satoshi never cashed out** (unlike every other founder in history and I bet that it never happens again)

It's impossible for anyone to ever replicate the exact way that Satoshi launched bitcoin because the genie is out of the bottle and cryptocurrency now exists so it's 100% impossible to ever have a cryptocurrency where the coins are circulating in the wild freely for 18 months before having any value like bitcoins were.

[Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/) exchange, [okcoin](https://www.okcoin.com/) exchange, and [strike app](https://beta.strike.me/faq) have already integrated the lightning network so that you can deposit and withdraw bitcoin using it, and [kraken](https://www.kraken.com/) exchange will also be integrating it this year.  

You can use the lightning network to send instant bitcoin payments to other lightning users, you can [buy anything online where Visa debit cards are accepted](https://paywithmoon.com/) using the lightning network, or you can [buy gift cards](https://www.bitrefill.com/) for practicality any big store from [more than one reputable business.](https://foldapp.com/) 

Using the lightning network has a similar feeling to discovering bitcoin all over again, and I suggest every American reading this to try out the [Strike App](https://beta.strike.me/faq). Strike app has no fees, and Americans can use cash to buy bitcoin and have it instantly sent anywhere using the lightning network, or they can send a lightning payment and receive cash in their bank. This means that Americans can also use Strike App to fund lightning integrated exchanges with bitcoin instantly, to fund your lightning channels with satoshis, or to pay lightning invoices instantly, and all without any fees.",daymonhandz

gvcaq90,1619023363,"Summary:

1. Zimbabwe: massive hyper inflation, but zimbabwe stock market is up, higher than ever. In real terms tho, the stock market has gone up much less than the zimbabwe currency had gone down.
2. Similar thing has been happening in the US: adjusting the s&amp;p500, for example, by the growth of the Fed's balance sheet shows a massive crash in 2008 and basically no recovery or growth since then.
3. Real estate market is similar - also up. Cpi inflation doesn't incorporate any meaningful components of real estate, health care, etc and so the reports of ""no inflation"" or ""controlled inflation"" are very disingenuous. Adjusting for Fed balance sheet shows the housing market has only shrunk since 2008. 
4. Housing price growth is a function of federal reserve policy, not a housing bubble. This money printing helps boomers and the wealthy who already own houses, but it's terrible for everyone else. This is a main driver of wealth inequality.
5. The government can't tax more, and they can't default on their debt, so their only choice is to print more money. 
6. The housing market should continue to do well, so should unmanipulatable things like bitcoin should go up as well.
7. Foreclosure protections for home owners will likely continue as long as possible. If protections like this The US will become much more centralized.
8. Anyone who is worried about deflation doesn't understand what's going on, were in an inflationary environment that will accelerate.

Oh well this is just based on a quick Google search - I don‚Äôt know the nitty gritty details. 

Charted the timeline of company launches on the price of BTC:

https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/p/pcU9ehzn.png

I included Kraken and Binance along with Coinbase as the major US exchanges to purchase and sell crypto - Kraken is actually the oldest company, Coinbase a close second. All the other companies don‚Äôt pop up until 2018, and - you‚Äôll notice - during a bear run. 

Ledn didn‚Äôt launch until last May 2020. 

All of the other companies successfully survived the 72% BTC drop during Covid - 

(This hockey stick chart is absolutely insane to contemplate btw) 

I have no idea what the future holds - though I have drunk the Koolaid and do believe it‚Äôs clear that crypto is the future of money and that fiat is broken.

Gold is expensive to store securely.

Gold is extremely expensive and slow to transport securely, especially large amounts.

Gold is heavy, it takes up space.

You can't walk very far carrying a lot of gold. You can't swim at all with more than a few coins of gold.

Gold can be confiscated. Gold has already been confiscated by the US government.

Highway robbers, corrupt border guards, pirates, and others can merely kill you, then take any gold you were transporting.

Tungsten's density is very close to that of gold. There are now gold-coated tungsten bars in circulation. It requires special equipment and know-how to detect gold-coated tungsten.

Bitcoin is easy and inexpensive to store securely.

Bitcoin is inexpensive to transport, and compared to gold, transporting Bitcoin is 'instantaneous'.

Bitcoin weighs nothing and takes up little, if any space.

Bitcoin cannot be detected and can pass right through any border or airport.

Bitcoin won't stop refugees from walking long distances, nor from swimming across rivers.

Bitcoin cannot be confiscated. Robbers, pirates, corrupt cops, soldiers, etc. won't know you own any (unless you tell them), and they cannot merely kill you and take your Bitcoin.

Bitcoin can be sent across the Internet.

gvciq52,1619026703,"Great question - That‚Äôs always the top consideration - what are the risks? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts - 

here‚Äôs what comes to mind for me, based on common sense and what I‚Äôve read: 

1. The platform gets hacked. As commented on in the spreadsheet, Blockfi did get hacked in May 2020. No funds were stolen but marketing data was compromised. It was a social engineering hack. Blockfi responded by hiring a new security officer. If anyone is aware of other hacks, it would be helpful to hear about it. 

2. The platform steals your money and it‚Äôs an inside job. I‚Äôll look into this more when I can - Why hasn‚Äôt it happened so far with these companies? Has it happened with other companies? I read something about a company called Cred imploding. 

3. Non-stablecoin crypto drops dramatically in value as it historically tends to do - this is more of a global issue. I guess you might be in hot water if you took a loan - but Celsius (the only decent platform to take a loan from if you care about low APY) is clear on how what price point BTC your loan would be margin called/liquidated - I think that‚Äôs as good as it‚Äôs going to get as far as taking a loan goes. You have to stay aware of the price and your repayment schedule. 

I‚Äôm not an expert in these matters - and none of this is financial advice. These are simply yield on crypto platforms that are visible and available in the US that I‚Äôve decided to use. 

Everyone has different risk tolerance and goals - some people keep all of their coins in cold wallets with the sixteen keywords laminated and stored in two fireproof locations half the world apart. 

Btw and what happens to stablecoin when crypto is in a bear market? I think by definition it should remain stably pegged to fiat, but I haven‚Äôt looked into it deeply - can anyone comment on that? 

I was considering getting a hardware wallet - and I admit that in the euphoria of seeing interest grow day by day in an app - where I can check it idly 17 times a day - I may have allowed greed to overcome my common sense (that is, it‚Äôs safer to have your own keys and coins). 
Nevertheless, when crypto has mass adoption - I wonder if everyone will really have a hardware wallet in a safe somewhere - or if we‚Äôll naturally transition to using apps - maybe that‚Äôs a different question than what you‚Äôre pointing. I‚Äôm just saying, I think there‚Äôs something very natural about managing money this way - with interest, in an app - although, it‚Äôs also very addictive. maybe even intentionally addictive. Smart phones are addictive - money on smart phones that fluctuates in price while earning interest is killer-addictive. 

So there‚Äôs that - if you had some other considerations that didn‚Äôt occur to me, would be very helpful to hear them.",Fluffy_Rest9712

First off, most of the lost coins occurred before people really understood the value Bitcoin would have.  There are laptops in landfills with thousands of coins locked behind a lost private key because at the time they were trading at pennies each.  That said, there will always be lost coins due to deaths without documenting the private key for loved ones, improper backups, etc; however it'll reduce as people become more accustomed to blockchain best practices.

In the end, it doesn't matter how much is lost because Bitcoin is divisible by 100,000,000 pieces, or what we call Satoshi's.  If 50-years from now Bitcoin is worth $10,000,000 because of scarcity, the likely we'll either refer to Bitcoin as what we call a Satoshi, or we'll start trading Satoshi's today.  Almost like we talk think about gold's value in ounces, but heavy hitters buy and store [bars of gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_bar).

One final thing, Satoshi actually answered this question [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=13.msg46#msg46).

I hardly ever move my BTC between wallets but I can tell you this was by far the longest I've ever waited (thus most stressful) and for the amount I was transferring I definitely would have paid a higher fee if I could to get it confirmed faster. 

My theory: lots of transactions right now with low fees that can't be modified by the people making them being pushed far back in the queue and a lot of people willing to pay a lot just to confirm faster.

The OP is describing a ""run on the bank"" scenario in which the US factually ran out of gold to back up it's bank notes because they issued more bank notes than they had in gold reserves. This doesn't make sense for BTC. If everyone tried to sell BTC tomorrow, what would happen is the price would crash, but at no point would the system run out of USD. BTC is an exchanged commodity, not backed by anything. If you sell your BTC you will get exactly what someone else is willing to pay for it. There is no central authority to run out of anything.

USDT is a better example than BTC because you can have a ""run on the bank"" scenario with USDT and if they don't have the USD to back it up, then the last people banging at the door are left holding a bag with zero value (bankruptcy of USDT).

Bitcoin's value can increase for many reasons, but I'll group into to two large drivers: inflation and demand.

If inflation stays at zero, but everyone on the planet now wants to own one entire Bitcoin, that'll drive the price up to millions of dollars because of increased **demand**.  Since our world is mostly transacting in fiat today then no, the price of a car or a gallon of milk will stay flat but your Bitcoin is worth more.  You can buy more gallons of milk with your coin.

If **inflation** increases (and likely will due government spending) then everything increases in price.  A car or a gallon of milk will increase in price but so will Bitcoin because there's more fiat being passed between person to person.

gvcsrb3,1619030947,"That's how I see it for the next few years. One of the most important use of bitcoin right now is buying and selling on exchanges (since it's in its appreciation phase), so I'lll use this as an example:

*  *Legacy 'onchain' method:*
   * Buy  on exchange -&gt; regular, expensive, onchain withdrawal fees to HW =  immediate self-custody, overall expensive cumulative fees and  many  UTXOs (i.e. more expensive future fees)
* *LN method:*
   * Buy  on exchange -&gt; regular, supercheap, LN withdrawal to LN wallet  (extra fees at 1st withdrawal to get inbound liquidity) -&gt; rare  onchain transfer to HW (swap-out fees)  = immediate self-custody,  overall much cheaper fees and less UTXOs (i.e. cheaper future fees)

With time passing, the frequency of moving from LN to onchain will decrease as the fees will increase and the secuirty for the LN will also increase.

Start simple with a Phoenix wallet, or Muun or Breez. No need to manage the channels. If you're interested to do this yourself, you could then dive deeper with Eclair Wallet or even with a dedicated private or even routing node.

The main thing is to get connected to the LN network :) Once done, you can stay connected for years and just benefit for the low fees at any time. I've had my Eclair wallet working for more than 2 years now, with a channel opened with Acinq during all that time (and I don't have internet very regularly, that's no problem unless you plan to be offline for weeks and weeks).",jyv3257e

Last I looked they pre-fill a suggested fee amount to the relevant little text field. If you click ""MAX"", and you have X bitcoins on your account, it will send you X-Y bitcoins and include Y as the transaction fee. There will be exactly zero left on your CB account.

NB: their web page used to have an ""amusing"" bug in it: when you clicked ""MAX"" or typed your own (sensible) transaction fee, a warning window would pop up saying the fee was too low. And when you click to let them decide the fee, it would pre-fill that text field with an absurdly high transaction fee, like $50 worth. HOWEVER, if you simply ignored that warning popup and included the fee you wanted, the transaction would go through fine.

I'm telling you all this because the Pro Coinbase site seems to be in a state of constant flux but all in all it works fine. It also has bizarre quirks, like you have to paste (or CTRL-V) the receiving address in a certain order, otherwise the page rejects it, little stupid mini-bugs like that.

gvd44z2,1619035820,"&gt; 1. The platform gets hacked. As commented on in the spreadsheet, Blockfi did get hacked in May 2020

[$300 million](https://www.zdnet.com/article/billions-were-stolen-in-blockchain-hacks-in-2020/) were stolen through exchange hacks in 38 attacks. You might be interested in looking through this list: https://selfkey.org/list-of-cryptocurrency-exchange-hacks/

&gt; 2. The platform steals your money and it‚Äôs an inside job

Mt Gox was one of those. So was Crypsy. There's a whole bunch of other examples: https://masterthecrypto.com/bitcoin-scams/

Now, its not to say it'll happen with these companies. But it is a risk, even in the US. For eample, the CEO of Crypsy [fled the country](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-hands-nearly-1m-to-cryptsy-victims-after-settling-class-action-lawsuit) after stealing tons of cryptocurrency.

&gt; 3. crypto drops dramatically in value

Well if it drops in value, the risk I suppose is that you can't sell if you need/want to. But I don't see you mentioning tho that this would be a risk of default for anyone you lent cryptocurrency to in the case the value goes up. If they can't pay back, you don't get your money back. Bad for lenders and bad for creditors. 

So yeah, the risks to lending out your bitcoins are:

1. Risk of external hacks
2. Risk of inside job theft
3. Risk of normal borrower default
4. Additional risk of borrower default in the case of rise in currency value.
5. Risk of illiquidity in the case the value of the coin drops (and you want to sell). If there was a way to sell your loan contract, that would mitigate this.

gvd6e6m,1619036793,"Bitcoin is the first ever user owned currency. Some people like to compare it to gold but the thing with gold is when you buy and sell it on the macro level. You're not given actual gold, but a right to your gold, a stock, a bond, an iou that says you ""own"" this amount of gold. So who's in charge of making sure your gold is actually yours, it actually exists? The responsibility falls on the banks and in return the government. They work as a single entity as they are dependent on eachother. 

It is a centralized, inefficient system. One that has made those that run the game extremely wealthy at the expense of the majority. Just look at the covid crash. The Fed artificially pumped the market pouring 3 trillion+ into it, bailed the banks and gave them the power to trade more actively, more aggressively. The rich got richer while everyone else not playing the game got left out in the cold, it would take just about a year to get these people the help they needed. If this isn't a clear signal that we should not put so much faith in our current system,  I don't know what is. It's a ticking time bomb if you ask me. 

Thats the reason there is so still so much FUD being pushed by our media outlets. Keep the public doubtful and ignorant of the applications of btc and you extend the fiat systems lifetime. Defi is a space with so much potential but one that threatens the existence of these banks. 

Which brings me to the values of the founding fathers. They were freedom, limited government, and individual responsibility. Ask yourself what kind of ""limited"" government steps in to bailout failing banks? Trivial politics keeps the people divided and distracted. We are trained to consume and our choices are already predetermined. What kind of freedom is that?

gvd7ika,1619037274,"Sorry, I haven't been clear enough,

Alice joins by opening a channel with Bob.  A channel is an onchain transaction, and so requires onchain funds.  Alice, Bob or both can provide the on chain funding for that channel.  If Alice expects to be paying Bob, then she needs to fund at least some of the on chain transaction.  In fact, she might even fund all of it, in which case Bob is joining for free, although it would seem only decent to at least split the miner fee.

That is the first of only two on chain transactions.  The other is when (if?) they close the channel and do a second onchain reaction to dispurse the funds from the multisig address back to their own addresses, in whatever proportion they agree.

So at the start both parties agree who is contributing what to the address, and at the end, they both decide who gets how much back out of it.


While it is open, that channel can provide a route into the whole Lightning network.  When we talk about Alice and Bob, they might not just be individuals.  The might be, or they might be businesses or maybe even big exchanges, each with varying numbers of other channels.",BakersDozen

Sorry, you mentioned the IRS in your comment above, and I think I conflated that with the premise of the OP (bitcoin being made illegal and opens to confiscation by the State).

I unfortunately am not that unique, but to be fair, you could say that about any high-risk investment/endeavor (i.e.- I hope your small business doesn't tank, or else you're fucked!"" / ""I hope your currency doesn't experience massive inflation, or else you're fucked!"" / ""I hope you don't get hit by a bus on your way to the bank, or else you're fucked!""), but it's a moot point since we seem to be talking about different things.",Trxth

For sure the sender didn't lose any money, but whether they will resend the funds for you entirely depends on the ""website"" your talking about.  If was some random, anonymous, coin toss, gambling website, then you might need to do more than just ask them to resend.

&gt; I‚Äôm pretty sure the funds don‚Äôt go anywhere. It‚Äôll get purged from the mempool

Yes, the cheapest option would be for you to just wait two weeks and it will drop out of the mempool.  Then ask the website to resend the funds.

&gt; go through after the next difficulty adjustment right?

Your TXN will likely drop from the mempool in 13.5 days.  There is a less than 50% chance that the retarget will happen in the next 13.5 days.  If your transaction gets dropped, retarget won't help until the sender resends.",brianddk

There was talk fo some regulatory activity, and there was a loss of some hashpower, and Turkey said something. This caused a bit of a dip in the price.

A lot of big brainz traders like to maximise their trading power through leveraging - basically betting more coins than you have.  10x leverage means that you are betting ten times more.  The downside of this is that if the coin drops 10% then you are wiped out.  The dip above tripped this switch and so exchanges started automatically selling the coins of leveraged traders.  This pushed the price down further, which triggered the liquidating of still more leveraged traders. And so on.  This cascade turned a small dip into quite a big drop.

Trust me your great great grand kids will be paying that back with taxes They don't need to worry about taxing your bitcoin anyway. They are just going to convert the dollar to a highly traceable crypto. You won't be able to avoid paying taxes. Bitcoin only has value because it can be converted into fiat. They can just deem it to be counterfit and the exchanges won't be able to operate within the US and you won't be able to access your money outside without getting taxed at some point. They are only allowing bitcoin now to get people used to using crypto as currency. They still get tax revenue when you buy that lambo or house. Then again when you have to pay for registration or property taxes. Once enough people start avoiding taxes they won't stand for it. Politicians will always find a way to tax you.,baronvondanger

&gt; If the only nodes were run by miners then there would never be any development of the protocol in a direction that doesn't please the miners.

This is already true. Name one protocol change that was activated that negatively affected miners (that didn't produce a dead fork). On the flip side, every protocol change that is miner-neutral, user-beneficial activates without issue because whats good for bitcoin's price is good for miners. This sub has this false narrative where its ""users vs miners"", when in reality anyone who is well versed in game theory and has read the whitepaper would realize that the entire network is set up in a remarkably beautiful way in which miners acting selfishly actually makes the network *more secure*

The UASF scenario is a bad example because it never actually happened. In the event it activated you would have had the UASF chain (~15% of hash power), the segwit2x chain (70% of hash power), and the non-signalling miners. If it activated and the network forked, the UASF would have literally been a toss up between working as planned, existing as a minority fork (like BCH is now), or getting 51% attacked into oblivion depending on what the pre-market price discovery looked like.",bjorneylol

A conservative party has been ruling for almost 20 years, they are returning Islam back to Turkey, and they are trying to make Turkey an independent power. 

On the other hand, there is a secular party that is against the return of Islam. They want to follow the west rather than being independent. That's why they got western media support.

Turkey's history is full of military coups that end up with the seculars ruling. Even in this regime, a coup was attempted in 2016. The opposition isn't as weak as you think, in recent years they have been using their full power to basically dishonour the ruling government. Millions and millions of dollars on campaigns of all kinds, they are trying too hard. They even showed sympathy for conservatives to win their votes.

Without being able to strip back the effect of this manipulation, which has been engrained into society by shepherding governments over 100s of years (maybe 1000s), we will perpetuate a society based on greed, envy, material excess that is governed by a force underwritten in aggression ....Thoughts?",markinthemiddle

Yes you can, I just showed you.  Sure, its an approximation, but still, you can measure it within a certain error of margin.  It isn't a black box.



&gt;That link that you just posted is just an estimate and it's not accurate

It's an approximation and it is accurate.  These metrics have been widely accepted and used by the community since they existed.



&gt;Usually 5+ blocks were getting solved per hour in the last 24 hours. 6 blocks per hour means the hash rate is back where it belongs. Sometimes more than 8 blocks were getting solved per an hour today.

This is called natural variance and it's normal &amp; fully expected.

and I've already told you that you're wrong.

gvddjjm,1619039859,"Great summary. About to watch the video. It‚Äôs sad, but this totally incentivises anybody who knows what‚Äôs happening to take out cheap debt and buy assets such as real estate, which only makes the cycle worse and worse. 

You agree an amount of debt and repayment that ultimately means that by the time you pay it back (if you ever do, a lot of people just refinance forever), you‚Äôre barely paying any interest in real terms (if any). With that you buy assets that are being inflated everywhere by cheap money. 

The biggest example that seems to be happening worldwide is real estate. Here where I live, it‚Äôs quite disturbing. People set up limited companies for tax incentives purposes, take out 5-10 year fixed interest-only loans, rent out the property and make a profit and positive cash flow each month. They then wait a few years until equity builds as the house ‚Äòappreciates‚Äô, refinance with the bank to plough money into their next venture. Rinse, repeat.

On top of the limited building (supply) of housing, it‚Äôs contributing to a huge divide between those who own property and those who don‚Äôt. And for those unfortunate enough to not be able to get in on the action, they‚Äôre finding themselves increasingly further behind those who continue accumulating property.

I know a few people following this model, and they think it‚Äôs the smartest thing out there. I think it‚Äôs a legal form of theft.",No_Celery4566

However, it's not about being inflationary but about being able to adjust the money supply in response to economic conditions. That doesn't necessarily cause inflation.

The hyperinflation in Weimar Germany was caused by the French army occupying the Ruhr Valley (Germany's main industrial region) and the German workers going on strike in response. This absence of production caused the existing inflation problems from repaying war reparations to be exacerbated.

Of course if you reduce the availability of goods and services then you will get price increases. However, increasing the money supply doesn't necessarily leave the amount of goods and services unchanged, so you can increase the money supply without causing inflation. It all depends how the money is spent, that's the important consideration.",AbbydonX
